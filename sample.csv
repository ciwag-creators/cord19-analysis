This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of a thromboprophylaxis algorithm. This was a retrospective, single-center study in critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit (University affiliated Hospital) for acute respiratory failure due to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). From March 16 to April 9, 2020, thromboprophylaxis was adjusted according to weight (control group, n = 19) and after this date, thromboprophylaxis depended on an algorithm based on thrombotic and hemorrhagic risk factors (protocol group, n = 13). With regard to safety (number of major bleeding events and blood transfusions), the groups were not significantly different. With regard to efficacy, the number of thrombotic events decreased from 37 to 0%, p = 0.025 after implementation of the algorithm. Also, peak fibrinogen dropped from 8.6 (7.2–9.3) to 6.5 (4.6–8.4) g/L, p = 0.041 and D-dimers from 2194 (1464–3763) to 1486 (900–2582) ng/mL, p = 0.0001. In addition, length of stay declined from 19 (10–31) to 5 (3–19) days, p = 0.009. In conclusion, a tailored thromboprophylaxis algorithm (risk stratification based on clinical parameters and biological markers) reduce thrombotic phenomena in critically ill COVID-19 patients without increasing major bleeding.

The algorithm is built on the sensitivity matrix analysis using the methods of differential and linear algebra. It allows one to determine the parameters that are the least and most sensitive to data changes to build a regularization for solving an identification problem of the most accurate pandemic spread scenarios in the region. The performed analysis has demonstrated that the virus contagiousness is identifiable from the number of daily confirmed, critical and recovery cases. On the other hand, the predicted proportion of the admitted patients who require a ventilator and the mortality rate are determined much less consistently. It has been shown that building a more realistic forecast requires adding additional information about the process such as the number of daily hospital admissions. In our study, the problems of parameter identification using additional information about the number of daily confirmed, critical and mortality cases in the region were reduced to minimizing the corresponding misfit functions. The minimization problem was solved through the differential evolution method that is widely applied for stochastic global optimization. It has been demonstrated that a more general COVID-19 spread compartmental model consisting of seven ordinary differential equations describes the main trend of the spread and is sensitive to the peaks of confirmed cases but does not qualitatively describe small statistical datasets such as the number of daily critical cases or mortality that can lead to errors in forecasting.

We aimed to determine whether stable preterm infants could maintain thermoregulation for 48 h in a low-cost incubator (LCI). METHODS: The LCI was constructed using a servo-heater costing 200 USD and cardboard infant-chamber. We conducted this open-labeled non-inferiority randomized controlled trial in a tertiary level teaching hospital in India from May 2017 to March 2018. Preterm infants on full feeds and receiving incubator or radiant warmer care were enrolled at 32 to 36 weeks post-menstrual age. We enrolled 96 infants in two strata (Strata-1< 33 weeks, Strata-2 ≥ 33 weeks at birth). Infants were randomized to LCI or standard single-wall incubator (SSI) after negative incubator cultures and monitored for 48 h in air-mode along with kangaroo mother care. The incubator temperature was adjusted manually to maintain skin and axillary temperatures between 36.5 °C and 37.5 °C. During post-infant period after 48 h, SSI and LCI worked for 5 days and incubator temperatures were measured. The primary outcome was maintenance of skin and axillary temperatures with a non-inferiority margin of 0.2 °C. Failed thermoregulation was defined as abnormal axillary temperature (< 36.5 °C or >37.5 °C) for > 30 continuous-minutes. Secondary outcomes were incidence of hypothermia and required incubator temperature. Trial registration details: Clinical Trial Registry - India (CTRI/2015/10/006316). FINDINGS: Prior to enrollment 79(82%) infants were in radiant warmer and 17(18%) infants were in incubator care. Median weight at enrollment in Strata-1 and Strata-2 for SSI vs. LCI was 1355(IQR 1250–1468) vs. 1415(IQR 1280–1582) and 1993(IQR 1595–2160) vs. 1995(IQR 1632–2237) grams. Mean skin temperature in Strata-1 and Strata-2 for SSI vs. LCI was 36.8 °C ± 0.2 vs. 36.7 °C ± 0.18 and 36.8 °C ± 0.22 vs. 36.7 °C ± 0.19. Mean axillary temperature in Strata-1 and Strata-2 for SSI vs. LCI was 36.9 °C ± 0.19 vs. 36.8 °C ± 0.16 and 36.8 °C ± 0.2 vs. 36.8 °C ± 0.19. Mixed-effect model done for repeated measures of skin and axillary temperatures showed the estimates were within the non-inferiority limit; -0.07 °C (95% CI -0.11 to -0.04) and -0.06 °C (95% CI -0.095 to -0.02), respectively. Failed thermoregulation did not occur in any infants. Mild hypothermia occurred in 11 of 48(23%) of SSI and 16 of 48(33%) of LCI, OR 1.28 (95%CI 0.85 to 1.91). Incubator temperature in LCI was higher by 0.7 °C (95%CI 0.52 to 0.91). In the post-infant period SSI and LCI had excellent reliability to maintain set-temperature with intra-class correlation coefficient of 0.93 (95%CI 0.92 to 0.94) and 0.96 (95%CI 0.96 to 0.97), respectively. INTERPRETATION: Maintenance of skin and axillary temperature of stable preterm infants in LCI along with kangaroo mother care was non-inferior to SSI, but at a higher incubator temperature by 0.7 °C. No adverse events occurred and LCI had excellent reliability to maintained set-temperature.

Design: A living, systematic review. Database: We conducted searches in the centralized repository L·OVE (Living OVerview of Evidence). L·OVE is a platform that maps PICO questions to evidence from the Epistemonikos database. In response to the COVID-19 emergency, L·OVE was adapted to expand the range of evidence it covers and customized to group all COVID-19 evidence in one place. Today it is maintained through regular searches in 39 databases. Methods: We included randomized trials evaluating the effect of macrolides as monotherapy or in combination with other drugs versus placebo or no treatment in patients with COVID-19. Randomized trials evaluating macrolides in infections caused by other coronaviruses, such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and non-randomized studies in COVID-19 were searched in case we found no direct evidence from randomized trials. Two reviewers independently screened each study for eligibility, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. Measures included all-cause mortality; the need for invasive mechanical ventilation; extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, length of hospital stay, respiratory failure, serious adverse events, time to SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR negativity. We applied the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. A living, web-based version of this review will be openly available during the COVID-19 pandemic. We will resubmit it every time the conclusions change or whenever there are substantial updates. Results: The search in the L·OVE platform retrieved 424 references. We considered 260 as potentially eligible and were reviewed in full texts. We included one randomized clinical trial that evaluated the use of azithromycin in combination with hydroxychloroquine compared to hydroxychloroquine alone in hospitalized patients with COVID 19. The estimates for all outcomes evaluated resulted in insufficient power to draw conclusions. The quality of the evidence for the main outcomes was low to very low. Conclusions: Macrolides in the management of patients with COVID 19 showed no beneficial effects compared to standard of care. The evidence for all outcomes is inconclusive. Larger trials are needed to determine the effects of macrolides on pulmonary and other outcomes in COVID-19 patients.

It has been detected in healthy dogs and dogs with diarrhea, hemorrhagic gastroenteritis, and vasculitis. It comprises five genotypes and is frequently found as a coinfection with canine parvovirus-2 (CPV-2). AIM: To characterize canine circovirus genotypes co-circulating with CPV-2 in Vietnam. METHOD: PCR assessment of 81 CPV-2-positive fecal samples from Vietnamese diarrheic dogs up to seven months of age for other viral enteric pathogens, including canine bocavirus, canine adenovirus, paramyxovirus, canine coronavirus, porcine circovirus-3 and canine circovirus. In addition, eight selected full genome sequences of Vietnamese canine circovirus were analyzed and used for phylogeny. RESULTS: In total 19.8% of samples were found to be positive for canine circovirus. Phylogeny revealed that the Vietnamese canine circovirus strains were clustered in two different genotypes (genotype-1 and -3). The genetic diversity among Vietnamese canine circovirus was 86.0–87.2%. The nucleotide discrepancy among both genotypes altered the deduced amino acid sequence in 14 and ten residues of the replicase and capsid proteins, respectively. Genetic recombination analysis revealed that the Vietnamese canine circovirus-6 strain has the American and Chinese canine circovirus as its major and minor parents, respectively. Only a single dog revealed triple detections of CPV-2c, Canine circovirus and canine adenovirus (1.2%). CONCLUSION: The co-circulation of two different genotypes of canine circovirus and CPV-2c in dogs in Vietnam has been illustrated.

METHODS: From Dec 31, 2019, to Apr 5, 2020, a total of 132 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients with diabetes from two hospitals were retrospectively included in our study. Clinical, laboratory and chest CT data were analyzed and compared between the two groups with an admission glucose level of &#8804;11 mmol/L (group 1) and >11 mmol/L (group 2). Logistic regression analyses were used to identify the risk factors associated with in-hospital death and complications. RESULTS: Of 132 patients, 15 died in hospital and 113 were discharged.

An empirical study",10.1007/s43545-021-00281-9,PMC8606240,34841265,no-cc,"More than one million forcefully displaced Myanmar nationals, known as Rohingyas, are currently living in the 34 camps in the Cox’s Bazar district in Bangladesh. To reduce the pressure of Rohingyas in Cox’s Bazar, the government of Bangladesh has started the process of relocating some of the Rohingyas to Bhasan Char Island located in Noakhali district, Bangladesh. However, some international organisations, NGOs, and some people expressed their concerns over this relocation process. This article, thus, offers an evidence-based holistic perspective that explains the available facilities and opportunities that could bring a new hope instead of a threat to Rohingyas. Through a multi-method research approach, the paper argues that the Island is suitable for the displaced Rohingya people.

A greater understanding of what comprises the carbon footprint of care in healthcare systems will identify potential strategies for reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In respiratory care, the focus has been on preventer inhalers, thereby omitting contributions from other aspects such as healthcare resource utilisation (HCRU) and reliever inhaler use. The healthCARe-Based envirONmental cost of treatment (CARBON) programme aims to provide a broader understanding of the carbon footprint associated with respiratory care. METHODS: CARBON will quantify the carbon footprint of medications and HCRU among approximately 2.5 million patients with respiratory diseases from seven ongoing studies spanning more than 40 countries. Across studies, to obtain the carbon footprint of all inhaled, oral, and injectable medications, SimaPro life cycle assessment software modelling resource and energy consumption data, in addition to Ecoinvent® data sets and certified published studies, will be used. The carbon footprint of HCRU in the United Kingdom will be estimated by applying the methodology and data obtained from the Sustainable Healthcare Coalition Care Pathway Guidance. PLANNED OUTCOMES: In asthma, CARBON studies will quantify GHG emissions associated with well-controlled versus not well-controlled asthma, the contribution of short-acting ß2-agonist (SABA) reliever inhalers (and their potential overuse) to the carbon footprint of care, and how implementation of treatment guidelines can drive improved outcomes and footprint reduction. In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), CARBON studies will assess the impact of exacerbation history on GHG emissions associated with HCRU and SABA use in subsequent years and estimate the carbon footprint associated with all aspects of COPD care. CONCLUSION: CARBON aims to show that the principle of evidence-led care focused on improvement of clinical outcomes has the potential to benefit patients and the environment.",2022,"Wilkinson, Alex; Maslova, Ekaterina; Janson, Christer; Xu, Yang; Haughney, John; Quint, Jennifer K; Budgen, Nigel; Menzies-Gow, Andrew; Bell, John; Crooks, Michael G",Adv. ther,,#mdl-35279810,,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12325-022-02076-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35279810/,247408361.0

Such patterns have implications for health and wellbeing if there are differences in health-promoting or health-hindering resources in neighborhoods or regions. We conducted a systematic review to assess sexual minority concentration in relation to area unit characteristics. METHODS We included only records published after 1973 and made no exclusions by geography or language. We searched 11 databases (Academic Search Complete, CINAHL, Embase, GeoBase, GeoRef, LGBT Life, PsycINFO, PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Sociological Abstracts, Web of Science) on November 19-21, 2016. We searched reference lists of included records. We used the following inclusion criteria: (1) Record is a quantitative study (that is, it uses statistics to describe or associate two or more variables); (2) Record is about (a) migration or internal migration of, (b) area unit selection by, or (c) concentration of sexual minority people (defined by identity, behavior, or attraction); (3) Criterion 2 is linked to the characteristics of regions or neighborhoods (at any spatial scale). RESULTS Dual independent coding resulted in 51 records meeting inclusion criteria from the original pool of 5,591. From these records, we identified the 647 reported results linking sexual minority concentration with area unit characteristics. Of these, 132 were unadjusted relationships between sexual minority concentration and four theory-informed domains of neighborhood influence on health. We identified greater concentration of sexual minorities in regions with more resources and in more urban regions. A limited but troubling literature at the neighborhood level suggested potentially higher concentrations of sexual minorities in neighborhoods with fewer resources. CONCLUSIONS There are substantial gaps in the literature. We discuss the implications of our findings and gaps in relation to key theories of sexual minority health.

The most affected countries of the world are USA, Brazil, India, Italy, Iran, Spain, Russia, South Africa, United Kingdom and Peru. In Pakistan, the pilgrims from Iran became the major source of spread of the virus in the country, as the Government did not impose quarantine measures to restrict their movement. In Pakistan, the most affected province was Sindh followed by Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. According to WHO, the most common symptoms are fever, dry cough, sore throat, fatigue and diarrhea and shortness of breath in severe cases. The virus attacks throat, lungs and trachea converting them to virus factories to infect more cells. It attacks not only lungs but also other vital organs of the body like kidneys and heart. It is spread from human to human through respiratory droplets or direct contact. Moreover, there have been reports of the mixed infection of coronavirus with other bacteria, fungi and viruses. Various methods are used for the detection of the virus such as nucleic acid and immunological methods but RT-PCR is considered as the most reliable. Some antiviral drugs have shown to be effective against the virus like Favilavir, Remdesivir, Chloroquine, hydroxy-chloroquine, Tocilizumab etc. but further clinical studies are required to confirm their efficacy. In Pakistan, blood plasma therapy is in high demand but involves the risk of transmission of blood borne pathogens. As Pakistan lacks medical facilities. the government has to get testing kits and primers from other countries. Only few quarantine centers are available and there is shortage of drugs, beds, trained doctors and paramedical staff. Unfortunately, no vaccine is available yet so the only management strategy is the prevention of infection by wearing masks and following social distancing.

All participants underwent both rapid antibody tests and RT-PCR (at admission for patients). ResultsA total of 270 participants completed the study. Fever and URI symptoms were present in 6/210 patients (2.8%) while one patient (0.5%) had a history of traveling to a high-risk area. However, only two (1%) asymptomatic patients had positive IgM results.

This knowledge is particularly relevant when the therapeutic agents are remarkably adaptable and diverse biological entities capable of a plethora of interactions, most of which remain largely unexplored. Although phage therapy (PT) undoubtedly holds the potential to save lives, its current efficacy in case studies recalls the golden era of antibiotics, when these compounds were highly effective and the possibility of them becoming ineffective seemed remote. Safe PT schemes depend on our understanding of how phages interact with, and evolve in, highly complex environments. Here, we summarize and review emerging evidence in a commonly overlooked theme in PT: bacteria-phage interactions. In particular, we discuss the influence of quorum sensing (QS) on phage susceptibility, the consequent role of phages in modulating bacterial cooperation, and the potential implications of this relationship in PT, including how we can use this knowledge to inform PT strategies. We highlight that the influence of QS on phage susceptibility seems to be widespread but can have contrasting outcomes depending on the bacterial host, underscoring the need to thoroughly characterize this link in various bacterial models. Furthermore, we encourage researchers to exploit competition experiments, experimental evolution, and mathematical modeling to explore this relationship further in relevant infection models.

Such models are not unidirectional, in that actions of individuals, networks, communities and structural changes can also affect overall disease incidence and prevalence. In this commentary, we describe how the social ecological model (SEM) may be applied to describe the theoretical effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD). This model can provide a necessary framework to systematically guide time-sensitive research and implementation of individual-, community-, and policy-level interventions to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals with OUD.",2021,"Cowan, Ethan; Khan, Maria R; Shastry, Siri; Edelman, E Jennifer",Addict Sci Clin Pract,,#1015904,,,,,231193559.0

Some students struggle first with making this choice, and then, after the work is submitted, marked and the degree is completed, they have to deal with the frustration of leaving such projects behind and totally inconsequential. This may happen because the student is not oriented towards reflecting on how each of the possible topics to choose from can become a more or less impactful project 1) during the remainder of their studies, 2) for their professional development and future employability, and 3) in terms of supporting/helping a wider community, by solving a problem common to many. After analysing 35 generative boards/canvases retrieved from a diversity of professional sources, a taxonomy for the design of this kind of visual tools was optimised and a visual board—the Impact Plan—is proposed. It aims at obviating the lack of reflection on the moment of choosing a project, providing students with a matching process between their interpretation of the available or most interesting projects from said pool, and their motivations, capacities, ambitions, levels of altruism and perception of value.

Thus, the aim of the present study was to synthesize physiological and symptomatic responses during activities involving the arms relative to activities involving the legs in people with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Any study with a cross-sectional comparison of acute physiological (cardiorespiratory, metabolic) and symptomatic responses to activities performed with the arms versus the legs were included. Studies were sub-grouped based on the type of activity performed (cycle ergometer, resistance exercises, or functional test/activities). Eighteen studies with 423 individuals with COPD were included. Leg cycle ergometer resulted in greater tidal volume (137 mL), minute ventilation (4.8 L/min), and oxygen consumption (164 mL/min) than arm cycle ergometer, while symptomatic responses were similar. Resistance exercises resulted in similar physiological and symptomatic responses irrespective of whether the legs or the arms were involved while studies on functional activities report different results depending on the type and intensity of the activity performed. With the exception of cycle ergometer activities, physiological and symptomatic responses do not seem to depend on whether the arms or the legs are used, but rather seem to be task and intensity dependent. These novel findings suggest, for example, that strategies used to increase exercise tolerance should not be dependent on whether the arms or the legs are used, but rather the intensity of specific activity performed.",2019,"Frykholm, Erik; Lima, Vanessa Pereira; Selander, Hanna-Vega; Nyberg, Andre; Janaudis-Ferreira, Tania",COPD,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1080/15412555.2019.1674269; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31631711/,204812688.0

From the richest and most advanced nations to the poorest and least developed ones, it exposed all of our vulnerabilities. The loss of life, health disparities and economic adversities, aggravated by political and ideological tensions, added multiple layers of stress and anxieties to an already stressed American society. METHODS: The educational institutions in the United States from the central to the local units demonstrated coherence in leadership, guided with flexibility and compassion, which paved the way for smooth operations. However, anxiety among students and faculty of university and college campuses is undeniable. In-person instruction was halted. Research labs and offices were locked down or operating with limited personnel. Thus, the challenges to have timely instruction and to move the research enterprise forward have been enormous. Provided here is a perspective based on a literature search using PubMed and Google with search words “COVID-19, stress, college students”, “COVID-19, stress, US graduate students”, and “COVID-19, stress, postdoc researchers”. RESULTS: This article is an opinion piece, part personal and part peer experiences. It is presented in light of studies suggesting that the COVID-19 pandemic has imposed significant mental stress and anxiety upon students and faculty members within the academy. CONCLUSION: Loss of face-to-face interactions as a result of virtual instructions, lack of in-person mentoring, and loss of research productivity have affected mental health and well-being of the academic community.

This study focuses on the following questions: what is the new interest to telework for employees and what are the potential reasons for this? How much employees feel able to do their work remotely now and why? To answer these questions, we conducted a survey over several weeks, that involved employees coming from different industries (N=170), in order to collect their experience, skills and motivations for teleworking. The results show that adoption of telework is real for the respondents. Those who have experienced it present a strong motivation and a real capacity to use it, with almost no technological barriers. The theoretical model that we used, based on Technology Acceptance Models (TAM), has highlighted an important new factor of telework adoption: time saved in commuting.

Despite recent advances in understanding NOB physiology and taxonomy, there are currently very few cultured NOB or representative NOB genome sequences from marine environments. In this study, we employed enrichment culturing and genomic approaches in order to shed light on the phylogeny and metabolic capacity of marine NOB. We successfully enriched two marine NOB (designated MSP and DJ) and obtained a high-quality metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) from each organism. The maximum nitrite oxidation rates of the MSP and DJ enrichment cultures were 13.8 (0.1 mM nitrite as optimum) and 30.0 μM (0.3 mM nitrite) nitrite per day, respectively. Each enrichment culture exhibited different tolerance to varying nitrite and salt concentrations. Based on phylogenomic position and overall genome relatedness indices, both NOB MAGs were proposed as novel taxa within the Nitrospinota and Nitrospirota phyla. Functional predictions indicated that both NOB MAGs shared many highly conserve metabolic features with other NOB. Both NOB MAGs encoded proteins for hydrogen and organic compound metabolism and defense mechanisms for oxidative stress. Additionally, these organisms may have the genetic potential to produce cobalamin (an essential enzyme cofactor that is limiting in many environments) and thus may play an important role in recycling cobalamin in marine sediment. Overall, this study appreciably expands our understanding of the Nitrospinota and Nitrospirota phyla, and suggests that these NOB may play important biogeochemical roles in marine habitats.Importance Nitrification is a key process in the biogeochemical and global nitrogen cycle. Nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) perform the second step of aerobic nitrification (converting nitrite to nitrate), which is critical for transferring nitrogen to other organisms for assimilation or energy. Despite their ecological importance, there are few cultured or genomic representatives from marine systems. Here, we obtained two NOB (designated as MSP and DJ) enriched from marine sediments and estimated the physiological and genomic traits of these marine microbes. Both NOB enrichment cultures exhibit distinct responses to varying nitrite and salt concentrations. Genomic analyses suggest that these NOB are metabolically flexible (similar to other previously described NOB), and yet also have individual genomic differences that likely support distinct niche distribution. In conclusion, this study provides more insights into the ecological roles of NOB in marine environments.",2020-09-11,"Park, Soo-Je; Andrei, Adrian-Ştefan; Bulzu, Paul-Adrian; Kavagutti, Vinicius S; Ghai, Rohit; Mosier, Annika C",Applied and environmental microbiology,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1128/aem.01667-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32917751/,221635848.0

Methods Review of the literature related to acceptable delays for treatment of common orthopaedic conditions, experience of healthcare professionals from low resource communities and expertise of experienced surgeons. Results Guidelines for the management of cancellations of elective surgeries during a period of resource reallocation are proposed. Elective cases must not be postponed indefinitely as adverse outcomes may result. Triage of waiting lists should include continuous monitoring of the patient and close communication with families despite social distancing and travel restrictions. Telehealth becomes a necessity. Common orthopaedic conditions are triaged into four groups according to urgency and safe and acceptable delay. Categories proposed are Emergent (life and limb threatening conditions), Urgent (with-in seven days), Semi-elective (postponed for three months) and Elective (postponed for three to 12 months). In total, 25 common orthopaedic conditions are reviewed and categorized. Conclusion Given the uncertainty within healthcare during a pandemic, it is necessary to determine acceptable delays for elective conditions. We report our experience in developing guidelines and propose categorizing elective cases into four categories, based on the length of delay.

The survey was distributed from March 30th through April 13, 2020 through survivor networks and social media. RESULTS: Six hundred and three women visited the survey website during the study period and 555 (92.0%) completed the survey. Four hundred and eight (73.5%) provided information on coping strategies utilized during COVID-19. Among those who responded, the median age was 58 years (range 20-85) and 150 participants (40.8%) were undergoing active cancer treatment. Commonly utilized adaptive coping strategies included emotional support (159, 39.0%), self care (148, 36.3%), hobbies (139, 34.1%), planning (87, 21.3%), positive reframing (54, 13.2%), religion (50, 12.3%) and instrumental support (38, 9.3%). Many participants also relied on avoidance coping strategies including self distraction (111, 27.2%) and substance use (19, 4.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Most ovarian cancer survivors are using adaptive, problem-focused coping strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic, however many are practicing avoidance strategies as well. As coping mechanisms profoundly impact quality of life, oncology providers must assist patients in identifying coping strategies that optimize physical and psychological well-being.",2020,"Frey, Melissa K; Chapman-Davis, Eloise; Glynn, Shannon M; Lin, Jenny; Ellis, Annie E; Tomita, Shannon; Fowlkes, Rana Khan; Thomas, Charlene; Christos, Paul J; Cantillo, Evelyn; Zeligs, Kristen; Holcomb, Kevin; Blank, Stephanie V",Gynecol. oncol,,#933535,,,,,227060837.0

Up to now, clinical features and treatment of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported in detail. However, the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and coagulation has been scarcely addressed. Our aim is to investigate the blood coagulation function of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods In our study, 94 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were admitted in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. We prospectively collect blood coagulation data in these patients and in 40 healthy controls during the same period. Results Antithrombin values in patients were lower than that in the control group (p < 0.001). The values of D-dimer, fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products (FDP), and fibrinogen (FIB) in all SARS-CoV-2 cases were substantially higher than those in healthy controls. Moreover, D-dimer and FDP values in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection were higher than those in patients with milder forms. Compared with healthy controls, prothrombin time activity (PT-act) was lower in SARS-CoV-2 patients. Thrombin time in critical SARS-CoV-2 patients was also shorter than that in controls. Conclusions The coagulation function in patients with SARS-CoV-2 is significantly deranged compared with healthy people, but monitoring D-dimer and FDP values may be helpful for the early identification of severe cases.",2020-03-16,"Han, Huan; Yang, Lan; Liu, Rui; Liu, Fang; Wu, Kai-Lang; Li, Jie; Liu, Xing-Hui; Zhu, Cheng-Liang",Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1515/cclm-2020-0188; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32172226/,212729756.0

Methods: secondary analysis of an online mixed-methods survey open to all mental health care staff in the UK involving 363 staff working with women in the perinatal period. Results: staff perceived the mental health of perinatal women to be particularly vulnerable to the impact of stressors associated with the pandemic such as social isolation (rated by 79.3% as relevant or extremely relevant; 288/363) and domestic violence and abuse (53.3%; 192/360). As a result of changes to mental health and other health and social care services, staff reported feeling less able to assess women, particularly their relationship with their baby (43.3%; 90/208), and to mobilise safeguarding procedures (29.4%; 62/211). While 42% of staff reported that some women engaged poorly with virtual appointments, they also found flexible remote consulting to be beneficial for some women and helped time management due to reductions in travel time. Conclusions: delivery of perinatal care needs to be tailored to the needs of women; virtual appointments are perceived not to be appropriate for assessments but may be helpful for some women in subsequent interactions.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of this site greatly expanded. Tic and Tourette syndrome content also increased dramatically along with the number of patients with tics in neurology clinics. Objectives: We compared the phenomenology of “TikTok tics” to typical tic disorders. We chose to analyze the most widely viewed videos and therefore focused on the most popular content creators. Methods: Videos with the keywords “tic,” “Tourette,” or “tourettes” were reviewed to identify content creators between March 11, 2020 and March 30, 2021. We performed a quantitative assessment of TikTok tics as well as a descriptive analysis of the entire series of videos of each content creator. Results: The mean age of the cohort was 18.8 years old, and the majority were women. Unlike the predominance of facial movements in typical tics, arm movements were most frequent. Average tics per minute was 29, and almost all recorded TikTok tics were severe, causing significant disability. Whereas coprolalia and self-injurious behavior are only infrequently encountered in typical tic disorders, they were present in the overwhelming majority of TikTok subjects. Conclusions: TikTok tics are distinct from what is typically seen in patients with Tourette syndrome, although share many characteristics with functional tics. We believe this to be an example of mass sociogenic illness, which involves behaviors, emotions, or conditions spreading spontaneously through a group.

This study attempted to identify viruses from the upper respiratory tract in adults visiting emergency departments for clinically suspected CAP. Adults with suspected CAP enrolled in the ESCAPED study (impact of computed tomography on CAP diagnosis) had prospective nasopharyngeal (NP) samples studied by multiplex PCR (targeting 15 viruses and four intracellular bacteria). An adjudication committee composed of infectious disease specialists, pneumologists and radiologists blinded to PCR results reviewed patient records, including computed tomography and day 28 follow up, to categorize final diagnostic probability of CAP as definite, probable, possible, or excluded. Among the 254 patients enrolled, 78 (31%) had positive PCR, which detected viruses in 72/254 (28%) and intracellular bacteria in 8 (3%) patients. PCR was positive in 44/125 (35%) patients with definite CAP and 21/83 (25%) patients with excluded CAP. The most frequent organisms were influenza A/B virus in 27 (11%), rhinovirus in 20 (8%), coronavirus in seven (3%), respiratory syncytial virus in seven (3%) and Mycoplasma pneumoniae in eight (3%) of 254 patients. Proportion of rhinovirus was higher in patients with excluded CAP compared with other diagnostic categories (p = 0.01). No such difference was observed for influenza virus. Viruses seem common in adults attending emergency departments with suspected CAP. A concomitant clinical, radiological and biological analysis of the patient's chart can contribute to either confirm their role, or suggest upper respiratory tract infection or shedding.

In order to eradicate an infectious disease, a method of prevention with low social cost is the most effective way. While we wait for new therapies and a vaccine, we are proposing a solution based on the existing knowledge in biomedical sciences. Here we propose to use low doses of hydroxychloroquine (50-100 mg daily orally) and intranasal interferon alpha-2b (IFN &#945;-2b) spray (0.5 × 106 IU twice daily) for the prophylaxis of COVID-19. Although there are ongoing clinical trials to test the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis, there has not been any proposal to test the efficacy of IFN &#945;-2b together with hydroxychloroquine to increase protection against COVID-19. Since the two act on two different mechanisms, we strongly believe that the two could have additive effects in prophylaxis against COVID-19.

We assessed the effectiveness of brodalumab in patients with previous treatment failure of IL-17A inhibitor(s). METHODS Patients with psoriasis and previous treatment failure of an IL-17A inhibitor were treated with brodalumab at standard dose. Effectiveness was assessed after 12, 26 and 52 weeks of treatment. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients that had achieved an absolute psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) ≤2 and/or a relative reduction of PASI of 75% (PASI75) at week 12. Plasma cytokine levels were measured at baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment. RESULTS In total, 20 patients were included, 7 (35%) were female, the median age was 50 years, and the median baseline PASI was 13.5. Analyzing the data using non-responder imputation, 14 (70%) patients had achieved either PASI75 and/or PASI≤2, 8 (40%) had achieved PASI90, and 3 (15%) had achieved PASI100 at week 12. In total, 9 patients (45%) completed the 52-weeks trial and 7 patients (35%) still had PASI75 throughout 52 weeks. Seventeen out of 20 patients experienced any adverse events (AEs) during 52 weeks with no serious AEs or deaths. Patients responding to treatment had lower levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-6 at baseline compared with those who did not respond to treatment (TNF-α, p=0.041, IL-6, p=0.0054).

Workshop: Communication and adherence to public health measures in response to Covid-19 in Ireland,10.1093/eurpub/ckab164.583,PMC8574644,,no-cc,"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Governments across the world have implemented unprecedented public health measures to control the spread of the Covid-19 virus. Three research teams from Ireland, based in Trinity College Dublin (TCD), National University of Ireland, Galway (NUIG), and University College Cork, (UCC) were funded by the Health Research Board and the Irish Research Council to conduct research that would inform policy and practice in relation to the pandemic. The objective of this workshop is to present policy-relevant findings on the communication of public health measures on Covid-19 and factors associated with adherence to Covid-19 guidelines and regulations (e.g., hand washing, social distancing, travel restrictions and mask-wearing), drawing on the outputs from large scale, nationally representative quantitative surveys, a qualitative interview study, and a content analysis of COVID-19 poster communications. WORKSHOP- ADDED VALUE: The workshop will involve contributions from public health and behavioural scientists. It will provide a comprehensive overview of sociodemographic and psychosocial factors associated with adherence to public health guidelines and regulations on Covid-19 and of the extent to which the Irish Government's communication strategy adequately addressed these issues. COHERENCE BETWEEN THE PRESENTATIONS: All of the research to be presented was conducted during the early phase of the pandemic response in Ireland. The TCD team will present findings from cross-sectional weekly telephone surveys of adults resident on the island of Ireland (75:25 split between ROI & NI), conducted over eight weeks. A range of factors associated with adherence to national guidelines on handwashing and social distancing will be addressed, including socioeconomic status, threat perceptions, fear of COVID-19, response efficacy and self-efficacy, response cost and social norms, mood, loneliness, and self-reported health. The NUIG team aimed to identify psychosocial determinants of adherence to physical distancing and to determine whether Government of Ireland COVID-19 communications adequately address the determinants. The findings to be presented will draw on a nationally representative cross-sectional survey as part of the International COVID-19 Awareness and Responses Evaluation (iCARE) study, a qualitative interview study, and a content analysis of COVID-19 poster communications. The UCC team will present the findings from a series of four large, nationally representative cross-sectional telephone surveys, focused on the level of adherence and major socio-demographical determinants of adherence to travel restrictions and wearing of face coverings during the early phase of the pandemic response in Ireland. All presenters will reflect on the challenges of conducting applied research during a rapidly changing international crisis. KEY MESSAGES: Adherence to the public health measures was high overall, but with significant variation among sociodemographic groups and different factors influencing adherence to the different measures.

PDCoV has been successfully isolated using various medium additives including trypsin, and although we know it is important for viral replication, the mechanism has not been fully elucidated. Here, we systematically investigated the role of trypsin in PDCoV replication including cell entry, cell-to-cell membrane fusion and virus release. Using pseudovirus entry assays, we demonstrated that PDCoV entry is not trypsin dependent. Furthermore, unlike porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), in which trypsin is important for the release of virus from infected cells, PDCoV release was not affected by trypsin. We also demonstrated that trypsin promotes PDCoV replication by enhancing cell-to-cell membrane fusion. Most importantly, our study illustrates two distinct spreading patterns from infected cells to uninfected cells during PDCoV transmission, and the role of trypsin in PDCoV replication in cells with different virus spreading types. Overall, these results clarify that trypsin promotes PDCoV replication by mediating cell-to-cell fusion transmission but is not crucial for viral entry.

vmtpolv9,,WHO,Epitope based vaccine prediction for SARS-COV-2 by deploying immuno-informatics approach,,,,unk,"A new virus termed SARS-COV-2 (causing COVID-19 disease) can exhibit a progressive, fatal impact on individuals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the spread of the virus to be a global pandemic. Currently, there are over 1 million cases and over 100,000 confirmed deaths due to the virus. Hence, prophylactic and therapeutic strategies are promptly needed. In this study we report an epitope, ITLCFTLKR, which is biochemically fit to HLA allelic proteins. We propose that this could be used as a potential vaccine candidate against SARS-COV-2. A selected putative epitope and HLA-allelic complexes show not only better binding scores, but also RMSD values in the range of 0-1â¯Å. This epitope was found to have a 99.8% structural favorability as per Ramachandran-plot analysis. Similarly, a suitable range of IC50 values and population coverage was obtained to represent greater validation of T-cell epitope analysis. Stability analysis using MDWeb and half-life analysis using the ProtParam tool has confirmed that this epitope is well-selected.

To ultimately prevent spread of the virus into the human population, however, vaccination of dromedary camels – currently the only confirmed animal host for MERS-CoV – may be the best option to achieve a sustained drop in human MERS cases in time.

Adequately treating HIV early renders the infection a chronic medical condition and allows PLHIV with a suppressed viral load (PLHIV-s) to live normal lives. Despite this, safety concerns and a lack of high-level data have hindered the use of systemic psoriasis therapies in PLHIV-s. OBJECTIVES: We aim to provide a structured framework that supports healthcare professionals and patients discussing the risks and benefits of systemic psoriasis therapy in PLHIV-s. Our goal was to address the primary question, are responses to systemic therapies for the treatment of psoriasis in PLHIV-s similar to those in the non-HIV population? METHODS: We implemented an inference-based approach relying on indirect evidence when direct clinical trial data were absent. In this instance, we reviewed indirect evidence supporting inferences on the status of immune function in PLHIV. Recommendations on systemic treatment for psoriasis in PLHIV were derived using an inferential heuristic. RESULTS: We identified seven indirect indicators of immune function informed by largely independent bodies of evidence: (1) functional assays, (2) vaccine response, (3) life expectancy, (4) psoriasis manifestations, (5) rate of infections, (6) rate of malignancies, and (7) organ transplant outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Drug-related benefits and risks when treating a patient with systemic psoriasis therapies are similar for non-HIV patients and PLHIV with a suppressed viral load and normalized CD4 counts. Prior to initiating psoriasis treatment in PLHIV, HIV replication should be addressed by an HIV specialist. Exercise additional caution for patients with a suppressed viral load and discordant CD4 responses on antiretroviral therapy.

The areas with its highest concentrations within the EU are these most populated and industrialised ones. Excessive nitrogen dioxide concentrations are responsible for around 75,000 premature deaths of EU residents each year;in Poland, this value reaches almost 1,900. Since 2017, there have been new possibi-lities to measure NO2 concentration, made as part of the Copernicus Sentinels-5P Programme. Hence, it is purposeful to analyse changes in nitrogen dioxide emissions in the most important Polish cities against the EU in spring and summer 2020. The basis for the analysis was satellite data collected during the Copernicus Sentinels-5P Programme. In 2020, there were huge changes in NO2 concentration, which were the consequences of the implementation of restrictive safety measures relating to the COVID-19 pandemic: a significant reduction in road traffic and the closure or limiting of production in many industrial plants. It was found that, as a result of lockdown, nitrogen dioxide concentrations in Poland’s largest cities fell to a much lesser degree than in cities of similar size in southern or western Europe. The analyses indicated that data obtained from the Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite will play a key role in monitoring changes in nitrogen dioxide concentration throughout the EU. Ground-based observations of nitrogen dioxide concentrations, which have dominated until recently, will remain only of comparative importance in the assessment and analysis of the compound concentration. © 2021, Polish Society Magnesium Research.

Sox10 specifies pigment cell, glial, and neuronal lineages, whereas Sox9 is reportedly closely associated with skeletogenic lineages in the head, but its involvement in pigment cell formation has not been investigated genetically. Thus, it is not fully understood whether or how distinctly these genes as well as their paralogs in teleosts are subfunctionalized. We have previously shown using the medaka fish Oryzias latipes that pigment cell formation is severely affected by the loss of sox10a, yet unaffected by the loss of sox10b. Here we aimed to determine whether Sox9 is involved in the specification of pigment cell lineage. The sox9b homozygous mutation did not affect pigment cell formation, despite lethality at the early larval stages. By employing sox10a, sox10b, and sox9b mutations, compound mutants were established for the sox9b and sox10 genes and pigment cell phenotypes were analyzed. Simultaneous loss of sox9b and sox10a resulted in the complete absence of melanophores and xanthophores from hatchlings and severely defective iridophore formation, as has been previously shown for sox10a-/- ; sox10b-/- double mutants, indicating that Sox9b as well as Sox10b functions redundantly with Sox10a in pigment cell development. Notably, leucophores were present in sox9b-/- ; sox10a-/- and sox10a-/- ; sox10b-/- double mutants, but their numbers were significantly reduced in the sox9b-/- ; sox10a-/- mutants.

Following the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic, the survey acquired a new goal: how do the subjects of the follow-up sampling experience this severe stress situation, and in this experience, what role does physical activity and a salutogenetic sense of coherence play. Austrian women (N = 53) took part in the training program, whose physical condition was assessed before the start of the program, then reassessed after three months and after six months; the organizers also had them fill out the sense of coherence questionnaire (SOC) as well as the Regensburger insomnia scale. After the lifting of the lockdown introduced due to the pandemic, participants completed an online survey relating to their changed life conditions, physical activities, sense of coherence and sleep quality. Results: After the first three months of the training, no significant changes were detected. After six months, the participants SOC and sleep quality improved (Friedman test: p = 0.005 and p < 0.001). During the lockdown, sleep quality generally deteriorated (W-rank test: p = 0.001), while SOC did not change.

The possible use of smallpox as a bioterrorism agent as well as the continuous occurrence of zoonotic pox virus infections document the relevance to deepen the understanding for virus host interactions. Since the permissiveness of pox infections is independent of hosts surface receptors, but correlates with the ability of the virus to infiltrate the antiviral host response, it directly depends on the hosts proteome set. In this report the proteome of HEK293 cells infected with Vaccinia Virus strain IHD-W was analyzed by 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis and MALDI-PSD-TOF MS in a bottom-up approach. RESULTS: The cellular and viral proteomes of VACV IHD-W infected HEK293 cells, UV-inactivated VACV IHD-W-treated as well as non-infected cells were compared. Derivatization of peptides with 4-sulfophenyl isothiocyanate (SPITC) carried out on ZipTipμ-C18 columns enabled protein identification via the peptides' primary sequence, providing improved s/n ratios as well as signal intensities of the PSD spectra. The expression of more than 24 human proteins was modulated by the viral infection. Effects of UV-inactivated and infectious viruses on the hosts' proteome concerning energy metabolism and proteins associated with gene expression and protein-biosynthesis were quite similar. These effects might therefore be attributed to virus entry and virion proteins. However, the modulation of proteins involved in apoptosis was clearly correlated to infectious viruses. CONCLUSIONS: The proteome analysis of infected cells provides insight into apoptosis modulation, regulation of cellular gene expression and the regulation of energy metabolism. The confidence of protein identifications was clearly improved by the peptides' derivatization with SPITC on a solid phase support.

There is no standard treatment for patients who progress on temozolomide and patients are best treated within investigational clinical protocols. Patients harbouring tumours with functional O(6) methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) DNA repair enzyme have particularly poor prognosis with median overall survival of 12.7 months, compared to 21.7 months for patients with hypermethylated MGMT promoter. The pre-clinical studies have shown that Bortezomib depletes the MGMT enzyme, restoring the tumour ´s susceptibility to Temozolomide, if the chemotherapy is administered in the precise schedule when the MGMT enzyme is depleted. Additionally, Bortezomib shows an antitumour effect by blocking autophagy flux. Based on the promising pre-clinical results, a non-randomized, open label phase IB/II clinical trial was designed. The primary endpoints include assessment of safety of Bortezomib administered with Temozolomide for phase IB and median progression free survival, overall survival as well as progression free rate at 6 months. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Recurrent glioblastoma patients with unmethylated MGMT promotor, progressing at least 12 weeks after completion of postoperative radiotherapy, with adequate organ function, performance status Karnofsky 70 or better and radiologically measurable lesions are screened for study inclusion. The experimental treatment consists of Bortezomib 1.3mg/m(2) administered IV on days 1, 4, 7, during each 4-week chemotherapy cycle with per oral Temozolomide at 200mg/m(2) 5 days/week every 4 weeks starting on day 3. Study group will be compared to historical controls on conventional management. The sample size was calculated to 63 patients, ten of them were included in the phase IB. RESULTS: The phase IB of the trial was completed in 2019 and the combination of Temozolomide and Bortezomib was shown to be safe and well tolerated. Until April 2021 a total number of 23 patients were included into the trial. The patients are treated at 4 different referral university hospitals in Norway. A clinical treatment benefit with both radiological tumor volume response and stable disease were observed. The patient inclusion in the trial is delayed due COVID-19. The majority of observed side effects are mild or moderate. The grade 3 or 4 adverse effects included thrombocytopenia, ataxia, muscle weakness, delirium and hyperglycemia. Patients that progressed under the treatment received another line of therapy according to the institutional practice.

Emerging and reemerging pathologies are still considered to be dangerous to humanity because of the unique nature of these diseases: it is the encounter between two living organisms that have coexisted for millions of years within the people on the same planet without being previously recognized. These infectious agents, such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites, pose no threat to humans. In fact, only a few hundred are able to inflict damage to the human host. In addition, the spectrum of human disease caused by a particular pathogen varies considerably depending on the factors related to the ecological agent, the host, and the infectious agents. Several emerging or reemerging infectious agents are organisms that could be used in biological control. The differentiation of a natural epidemic from a bioterrorian event is based on several epidemiological indices as well as on the molecular characterization of the pathogen(s) involved. The role of pathologists is indeed very important. It is in this context that this chapter aims to discuss the various scientific advances, particularly molecular, in terms of diagnosis of these diseases; the new discoveries in the role of nanotechnologies and nanobiosensors; and also the implication of biomarkers, especially microRNAs (miRNAs), since it was reported that a single miRNA has the ultimate capacity to target multiple genes simultaneously. In a viral infection context, miRNAs have been connected with the interplay between host and pathogen and occupy a major role in the host–parasite interaction and pathogenesis. It is in this context that various molecular and nanomethods for the detection of emerging viruses and experimental validation of miRNAs during quelling viruses target transcripts will be discussed in this chapter.",2019-09-20,"Hammou, Rahma Ait; Benhassou, Mustapha; Bessi, Hlima; Ennaji, Moulay Mustapha",Emerging and Reemerging Viral Pathogens,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/253e1f73a3b18a13b56894ab4c611029ab1d5579.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149755.xml.json,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978012814966900007X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B978012814966900007X,203889632.0

Despite these findings, it is not clear if it is the lack of restriction that leads to the improvement. Our goal was to explore the effects of motor restrictions on divergent thinking for different movement states. In addition, we assessed whether spontaneous eye blinks, which are linked to motor execution, also predict performance. In experiment 1, we compared the performance in Guilford’s alternate uses task (AUT) during walking vs. sitting, and analysed eye blink rates during both conditions. We found that AUT scores were higher during walking than sitting. Albeit eye blinks differed significantly between movement conditions (walking vs. sitting) and task phase (baseline vs. thinking vs. responding), they did not correlate with task performance. In experiment 2 and 3, participants either walked freely or in a restricted path, or sat freely or fixated on a screen. When the factor restriction was explicitly modulated, the effect of walking was reduced, while restriction showed a significant influence on the fluency scores. Importantly, we found a significant correlation between the rate of eye blinks and creativity scores between subjects, depending on the restriction condition. Our study shows a movement state-independent effect of restriction on divergent thinking. In other words, similar to unrestrained walking, unrestrained sitting also improves divergent thinking. Importantly, we discuss a mechanistic explanation of the effect of restriction on divergent thinking based on the increased size of the focus of attention and the consequent bias towards flexibility.

Methods: We did an electronic search of COVID-19 related clinical studies registered between December 1, 2019 and February 21, 2020 (updated to May 28, 2020) from the ClinicalTrials.gov, and collected registration information, study details, recruitment status, characteristics of the subjects, and relevant information about the trial implementation process. Results: A total of 1,706 studies were included 10.0% of which (n=171) were from France, 943 (55.3%) used an interventional design, and 600 (35.2%) used an observational design. Most of studies (73.6%) aimed to recruit fewer than 500 people. Interferon was the main prevention program, and antiviral drugs were the main treatment program. Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine (230/943, 24.4%) were widely studied. Some registered clinical trials are incomplete in content, and 37.4% of the 1,706 studies may have had insufficient sample size.

The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to report on adverse outcomes among COVID-19 patients by statin usage. METHODS: Literatures were searched from January 2019 to December 2020 to identify studies that reported the association between statin usage and adverse outcomes, including mortality, ICU admissions, and mechanical ventilation. Studies were meta-analyzed for mortality by the subgroups of ICU status and statin usage before and after COVID-19 hospitalization. Studies reporting an odds ratio (OR) and hazard ratio (HR) were analyzed separately. RESULTS: Thirteen cohorts, reporting on 110,078 patients, were included in this meta-analysis. Individuals who used statins before their COVID-19 hospitalization showed a similar risk of mortality, compared to those who did not use statins (HR 0.80, 95% CI: 0.50, 1.28; OR 0.62, 95% CI: 0.38, 1.03).

In this work, a DL based model is proposed for recognizing and characterizing the inconsistencies in chest X-Ray pictures and arranging as unaffected, Covid affected, or Pneumonia. Considering the information inadequacy in clinical space, VGG architecture is utilized as the pre-trained models for building the model for recognition. The quality of the X-Ray pictures and noise present in the pictures influence the decision making leading to high false positives and false negatives. In the current model, pre-processed pictures are fed as input to the DL model accomplishing a maximum accuracy of 96.56%.

Children may experience emotional problems, somatic complaints, social isolation, depression, and post-traumatic stress as a result. Typical support networks often fail to meet the needs of these families. To address this gap, an innovative Child Life Specialist (CLS) program for patients with minor children at home was offered at a tertiary oncology center. Methods: To understand the feasibility of this program, we examined the demand for and implementation of the CLS program over its initial 10 months. Demand was characterized using administrative data (referred patient/family demographics, referral details, and disease/treatment characteristics). Implementation was described through encounter data (audience, type of visit, interventions provided, time for preparation, and time of direct interaction for each encounter). Results: The program received 100 referrals, 93 of whom accessed the program. Patients were most often female (66%) with a median age of 45 years (range: 19 to 72). 81% were parents of minor children, 10% grandparents, and 9% other. Families predominantly had multiple children (98%), most commonly school-aged (ages 5-9, 39%;10-14, 37%). 53% of families had two birth parents co-parenting in the same household;the remainder had alternate parent/living scenarios. Most referrals came from social work (57%). Median time from diagnosis to referral was 79 days (range: 9d-6.5y). Breast cancer (26%) was the most common diagnosis, followed by gastrointestinal (19%) and hematologic (16%). Cancer phase at referral was defined as at new diagnosis (within 30d, 18%), undergoing treatment with curative intent (20%), undergoing treatment with palliative intent (39%), at end of life (within 30d, 16%) and after death/bereavement (5%). 1 patient (1%) did not have cancer. The CLS recorded 257 unique encounters. 55% of encounters included patients, 40% non-patient parents, 21% children, and 21% others. 75% were individual encounters, while 25% were group encounters. 95% of encounters that included children also included an adult. Phone calls were the most frequent encounter type (43%), but hospital visits consumed the largest proportion of recorded CLS time (38%). Mean encounter time (all visit types) included 20min for preparation and 51min of direct interaction. CLS interventions included: Guidance on talking with children (67% of encounters), providing resources (37%), diagnostic teaching (21%), end-of-life support (18%), discussing change in status (10%), grief (8%), and emotional expression (4%).

The mean age of patients was 60 (SD 17) years, 119â657 (47%) of 254â288 were aged younger than 60 years, 143â521 (56%) of 254â243 were male, and 14â979 (16%) of 90â829 had no comorbidities. Case numbers increased across the three 4-week periods studied: by epidemiological weeks 19-22, cases were concentrated in the North, Northeast, and Southeast; by weeks 27-30, cases had spread to the Central-West and South regions. 232â036 (91%) of 254â288 patients had a defined hospital outcome when the data were exported; in-hospital mortality was 38% (87â515 of 232â036 patients) overall, 59% (47â002 of 79â687) among patients admitted to the ICU, and 80% (36â046 of 45â205) among those who were mechanically ventilated. The overall burden of ICU admissions per ICU beds was more pronounced in the North, Southeast, and Northeast, than in the Central-West and South. In the Northeast, 1545 (16%) of 9960 patients received invasive mechanical ventilation outside the ICU compared with 431 (8%) of 5388 in the South. In-hospital mortality among patients younger than 60 years was 31% (4204 of 13â468) in the Northeast versus 15% (1694 of 11â196) in the South. INTERPRETATION: We observed a widespread distribution of COVID-19 across all regions in Brazil, resulting in a high overall disease burden. In-hospital mortality was high, even in patients younger than 60 years, and worsened by existing regional disparities within the health system. The COVID-19 pandemic highlights the need to improve access to high-quality care for critically ill patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, particularly in LMICs.

The demand for advisory services and participation in the Common Agricultural Policy measures were used to compare the activities and perceptions of men and women young farmers. We found that there are no significant differences in participation of support measures and demand for advisory services across the genders. This suggests Lithuanian agricultural sector is equally beneficial for men and women young farmers.

Artificial intelligence encompasses a variety of areas, and one of its branches is deep learning (DL). Before the rise of DL, conventional machine learning algorithms involving feature extraction were performed. This limited their performance to the ability of those handcrafting the features. However, in DL, the extraction of features and classification are entirely automated. The advent of these techniques in many areas of medicine, such as in the diagnosis of epileptic seizures, has made significant advances. In this study, a comprehensive overview of works focused on automated epileptic seizure detection using DL techniques and neuroimaging modalities is presented. Various methods proposed to diagnose epileptic seizures automatically using EEG and MRI modalities are described. In addition, rehabilitation systems developed for epileptic seizures using DL have been analyzed, and a summary is provided. The rehabilitation tools include cloud computing techniques and hardware required for implementation of DL algorithms. The important challenges in accurate detection of automated epileptic seizures using DL with EEG and MRI modalities are discussed.

Systemic vaccination by this vector in mice, in which the expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor hACE2 has been induced by transduction of respiratory tract cells by an adenoviral vector, conferred only partial protection, despite an intense serum neutralizing activity. However, targeting the immune response to the respiratory tract through an intranasal boost with this LV resulted in > 3 log10 decrease in the lung viral loads and avoided local inflammation. Moreover, both integrative and non-integrative LV platforms displayed a strong vaccine efficacy and inhibited lung deleterious injury in golden hamsters, which are naturally permissive to SARS-CoV-2 replication and restitute the human COVID-19 physiopathology. Our results provide evidence of marked prophylactic effects of the LV-based vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 and designate the intranasal immunization as a powerful approach against COVID-19.

From the CDSR, we identified 20,227 meta-analyses of binary outcomes and 7,683 meta-analyses of continuous outcomes. Under the tolerable difference of 20% on the magnitude of the effects, the convergence proportion ranged from 24.24% (earliest 1 study) to 77.45% (earliest 10 studies) for meta-analyses of few earliest studies with binary outcomes.

This study aims to assess the association between the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and the incidence of severe COVID-19 infection. A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 210 patients with COVID-19 infection who were admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan from 27 January 2020 to 9 March 2020. Peripheral blood samples were collected and examined for lymphocyte subsets by flow cytometry. Associations between tertiles of NLR and the incidence of severe illness were analysed by logistic regression.Of the 210 patients with COVID-19, 87 were diagnosed as severe cases. The mean NLR of the severe group was higher than that of the mild group (6.6 vs. 3.3, P < 0.001). The highest tertile of NLR (5.1-19.7) exhibited a 5.9-fold (95% CI 1.3-28.5) increased incidence of severity relative to that of the lowest tertile (0.6-2.5) after adjustments for age, diabetes, hypertension and other confounders. The number of T cells significantly decreased in the severe group (0.5 vs. 0.9, P < 0.001). COVID-19 might mainly act on lymphocytes, particularly T lymphocytes. NLR was identified as an early risk factor for severe COVID-19 illness.

Cardiovascular diseases, kidney damage and neuropathy are the main cause of high mortality rates among individuals with diabetes. One effective therapeutic approach for controlling hyperglycemia associated with type-2 diabetes is to target alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase, enzymes that catalyzes starch hydrolysis in the intestine. At present, approved inhibitors for these enzymes are restricted to acarbose, miglitol and voglibose. Although these inhibitors retard glucose absorption, undesirable gastrointestinal side effects impede their application. Therefore, research efforts continue to seek novel inhibitors with improved efficacy and minimal side effects. Natural products of plant origin have been a valuable source of therapeutic agents with lesser toxicity and side effects. The anti-diabetic potential through alpha-glucosidase inhibition of plant-derived molecules are summarized in this review. Eight molecules (Taxumariene F, Akebonoic acid, Morusin, Rhaponticin, Procyanidin A2, Alaternin, Mulberrofuran K and Psoralidin) were selected as promising drug candidates and their pharmacokinetic properties and toxicity were discussed where available.

Despite having guidelines, cystoscopic findings are diverse and often challenging to classify. The extent of the false negatives and false positives in cystoscopic diagnosis is currently unknown. We suspect that there is a certain degree of under-diagnosis (like the failure to detect malignant tumours) and over-diagnosis (e.g. sending the patient for unnecessary transurethral resection of bladder tumors with anesthesia) that put the patient at risk. CONCLUSIONS: XAI robot-assisted cystoscopes would help to overcome the risks/flaws of conventional cystoscopy. Cystoscopy is considered a less life-threatening starting point for automation than open surgical procedures. Semi-autonomous cystoscopy requires standards and cystoscopy is a good procedure to establish a model that can then be exported/copied to other procedures of endoscopy and surgery. Standards also define the automation levels—an issue for medical product law. These cystoscopy skills do not give full autonomy to the machine, and represent a surgical parallel to ‘Autonomous Driving’ (where a standard requires a human supervisor to remain in the ‘vehicle’). Here in robotic cystoscopy, a human supervisor remains bedside in the ‘operating room’ as a ‘human‐in‐the‐loop’ in order to safeguard patients. The urologists will be able to delegate personal- and time-consuming cystoscopy to a specialised nurse. The result of automated diagnostic cystoscopy is a short video (with pre-processed photos from the video), which are then reviewed by the urologists at a more convenient time.",2022-01-27,"O’Sullivan, S.; Janssen, M.; Holzinger, Andreas; Nevejans, Nathalie; Eminaga, O.; Meyer, C.

Specifically, the virus infects isolated pulmonary epithelial cells and causes diffuse alveolar damage and hemorrhage in the lungs of infected patients. In addition, the virus may infect other organs, including the trachea, the intestines, and the brain, and it may penetrate the placental barrier and infect the fetus. Dysregulation of cytokines and chemokines is likely to be one of the key mechanisms in the pathogenesis of H5N1 influenza.

The tool could support public health decision-makers in implementation of an effective control strategy in a timely manner. METHODS: We used monthly surveillance data between 2004 and 2015 to predict case counts between 2016 and 2017 prospectively. The Turkish nationwide surveillance data set collected by the Ministry of Health contained 10 411 confirmed CCHF cases. We collected potential explanatory covariates about climate, land use, and animal and human populations at risk to capture spatiotemporal transmission dynamics. We developed a structured Gaussian process algorithm and prospectively tested this tool predicting the future year's cases given past years' cases. RESULTS: We predicted the annual cases in 2016 and 2017 as 438 and 341, whereas the observed cases were 432 and 343, respectively. Pearson's correlation coefficient and normalized root mean squared error values for 2016 and 2017 predictions were (0.83; 0.58) and (0.87; 0.52), respectively. The most important covariates were found to be the number of settlements with fewer than 25 000 inhabitants, latitude, longitude and potential evapotranspiration (evaporation and transpiration). CONCLUSIONS: Main driving factors of CCHF dynamics were human population at risk in rural areas, geographical dependency and climate effect on ticks. Our model was able to prospectively predict the numbers of CCHF cases.

FSOC is the degree to which a family perceives family life as comprehensible, manageable, and meaningful. To the best of our knowledge, few studies have used this scale, and very few have evaluated FSOC Scale psychometric properties. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the psychometric properties of the original FSOC Scale in a sample of Portuguese caregivers of children aged between 10 and 15 years. Methods: A total of 329 caregivers completed a sociodemographic questionnaire and the FSOC Scale. Analyses were performed to evaluate the factor structure of the FSOC Scale with 26 items as well as composite reliability, internal consistency, convergent-related validity, and discriminant-related validity of the scale scores. Results: The findings supported a three-factor solution for a 13-item version that maintains the original FSOC Scale structure. The three FSOC dimensions presented a good fit to the data. Cronbach’s alpha, composite reliability, and convergent-related validity were considered very good for the FSOC Scale (α = 0.956; CR = 0.974; AVE = 0.689). No evidence of discriminant-related validity was found for the dimensions of FSOC. Conclusion: The findings support the use of the Portuguese FSOC Scale for research and clinical purposes with Portuguese caregivers. Future research is necessary to further develop a European Portuguese version of the FSOC Scale. Implications: This study provides a psychometric evaluation of FSOC Scale characteristics in a Portuguese sample.

To cope with heterogeneous backgrounds, animals could either specialise on particular microhabitat patches, appearing cryptic in some areas but mismatching others, or adopt a compromise strategy, providing partial matching across different patch types. Existing studies have tested the effectiveness of compromise strategies in only a limited set of circumstances, primarily with small targets varying in pattern, and usually in screen-based tasks. Here, we measured the detection risk associated with different background-matching strategies for relatively large targets, with human observers searching for them in natural scenes, and focusing on colour. Model prey were designed to either ‘specialise’ on the colour of common microhabitat patches, or ‘generalise’ by matching the average colour of the whole visual scenes. RESULTS: In both the field and an equivalent online computer-based search task, targets adopting the generalist strategy were more successful in evading detection than those matching microhabitat patches. This advantage occurred because, across all possible locations in these experiments, targets were typically viewed against a patchwork of different microhabitat areas; the putatively generalist targets were thus more similar on average to their various immediate surroundings than were the specialists. CONCLUSIONS: Demonstrating close agreement between the results of field and online search experiments provides useful validation of online citizen science methods commonly used to test principles of camouflage, at least for human observers. In finding a survival benefit to matching the average colour of the visual scenes in our chosen environment, our results highlight the importance of relative scales in determining optimal camouflage strategies, and suggest how compromise coloration can succeed in nature.

Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that poor treatment adherence (P = .009, OR = 1.86, 95% CI: 1.17–2.96) and perceived illness worsening during the COVID-19 outbreak (P = .02, OR = 2.07, 95% CI: 1.15–3.73), being diagnosed with major depressive disorder (P < .001, OR = 2.79, 95% CI: 1.68–4.64), PHQ-9 total score (P < .001, OR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.15–1.24) and NPRS total score (P = .002, OR = 1.17, 95% CI: 1.06–1.29) were associated with higher risk of suicidality. After controlling for covariates, older psychiatric patients with suicidality had lower QOL compared to those without (F((1, 1063)) =16.5, P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Suicidality was common in older patients with clinically stable psychiatric disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic. Considering its negative impact on QOL and personal suffering, routine screening and preventive suicide measures should be implemented for older psychiatric patients.",2022-03-04,"Liu, Rui; Xu, Xiuying; Zou, Siyun; Li, Yulong; Wang, Huan; Yan, Xiaona; Du, Xiangdong; Zhang, Lan; Zhang, Qinge; Li, Wen; Cheung, Teris; Ungvari, Gabor S.; Ng, Chee H.; Xiang, Yu-Tao",J Geriatr Psychiatry Neurol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/a02e7a41d3912fc55ad4bf52cd97f7c9af2915f9.json,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35246000/; https://doi.org/10.1177/08919887221078557,247236425.0

To address that, we analyze how blame avoidance politics affected the struggle against COVID-19 in Brazil. Lack of strong accountability in a complex federative system led the country to a game of blame avoidance, which worsened compliance with social isolation policies and, thereby, COVID-19 results measured as confirmed cases and deaths of the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV2).

The nucleolus is the site of ribosome biogenesis and sequesters cell cycle regulatory complexes. Two of the major components of the nucleolus are fibrillarin and nucleolin. These proteins are involved in nucleolar assembly and ribosome biogenesis and act as chaperones for the import of proteins into the nucleolus. We have found that fibrillarin is reorganized in primary cells infected with the avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and in continuous cell lines that express either IBV or mouse hepatitis virus N protein. Both N protein and a fibrillarin-green fluorescent protein fusion protein colocalized to the perinuclear region and the nucleolus. Pull-down assays demonstrated that IBV N protein interacted with nucleolin and therefore provided a possible explanation as to how coronavirus N proteins localize to the nucleolus. Nucleoli, and proteins that localize to the nucleolus, have been implicated in cell growth-cell cycle regulation. Comparison of cells expressing IBV N protein with controls indicated that cells expressing N protein had delayed cellular growth. This result could not to be attributed to apoptosis. Morphological analysis of these cells indicated that cytokinesis was disrupted, an observation subsequently found in primary cells infected with IBV.

One of the three pathways of the complement system, the alternative complement pathway, plays a vital role in amplifying complement activation and pathway signaling. Complement factor D, a serine protease of this pathway that is required for the formation of C3 convertase, is the rate-limiting enzyme. In this review, we discuss the function of factor D within the alternative pathway and its implication in both healthy physiology and disease. Because the alternative pathway has a role in many diseases that are characterized by excessive or poorly mediated complement activation, this pathway is an enticing target for effective therapeutic intervention. Nonetheless, although the underlying disease mechanisms of many of these complement-driven diseases are quite well understood, some of the diseases have limited treatment options or no approved treatments at all.

Elucidation of the hierarchy and temporal order with which DNA damage sensors as well as repair and signaling factors assemble around chromosome breaks has painted a complex picture of tightly regulated macromolecular interactions that build specialized compartments to facilitate repair and maintenance of genome integrity. While many of the underlying interactions, e.g. between repair factors and damage-induced histone marks, can be explained by lock-and-key or induced fit binding models assuming fixed stoichiometries, structurally less well defined interactions, such as the highly dynamic multivalent interactions implicated in phase separation, also participate in the formation of multi-protein assemblies in response to genotoxic stress. Although much remains to be learned about these types of cooperative and highly dynamic interactions and their functional roles, the rapidly growing interest in material properties of biomolecular condensates and in concepts from polymer chemistry and soft matter physics to understand biological processes at different scales holds great promises.

These are disproportionately reported when patients are in their usual residence when compared with hospital or hospice. While patient safety incident reporting systems can support professional learning, it is unclear whether these reports encompass patient and carer concerns with palliative medications or interpersonal safety. AIM: To explore and compare perceptions of (un)safe palliative medication management from patient, carer and professional perspectives in community, hospital and hospice settings. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will use an innovative mixed-methods study design combining systematic review searching techniques with cross-sectional quantitative descriptive analysis and interpretative qualitative metasynthesis to integrate three elements: (1) Scoping review: multiple database searches for empirical studies and first-hand experiences in English (no other restrictions) to establish how patients and informal carers conceptualise safety in palliative medication management. (2)Medication incidents from the England and Wales National Reporting and Learning System: identifying and characterising reports to understand professional perspectives on suboptimal palliative medication management. (3) Comparison of 1 and 2: contextualising with stakeholder perspectives. PATIENT AND PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT: Our team includes a funded patient and public involvement (PPI) collaborator, with experience of promoting patient-centred approaches in patient safety research. Funded discussion and dissemination events with PPI and healthcare (clinical and policy) professionals are planned. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Prospective ethical approval granted: Cardiff University School of Medicine Research Ethics Committee (Ref 19/28). Our study will synthesise multivoiced constructions of patient safety in palliative care to identify implications for professional learning and actions that are relevant across health and social care.

This study takes a novel approach by examining self-expansion as a driver that prompts loyal fans to action. When brands offer self-expansive opportunities on their pages, in the form of new knowledge, new perspectives (e.g., awareness on social issues) and exciting experiences, fans may incorporate these in their sense of self (self-page inclusion) and reciprocate by investing their own resources to brand pages. A survey was conducted with 238 millennial users who have a favorite brand page on Instagram. The findings show that the more fans gain opportunities for self-expansion from their favorite pages, the more likely they are to share and create brand-related content.

Surgical approaches vary substantially with little data on efficacy and safety. OBJECTIVE Summarize the literature on HS surgery with regards to patient characteristics, surgical approaches, and study quality. Compare postsurgical recurrence rates with a meta-analysis. METHODS PubMed, Embase, and Scopus were searched for studies on surgical HS management published after 2004. A random effects meta-analysis of recurrence rates was performed on eligible studies. RESULTS Of 715 identified studies, 59 were included in the review and 33 in the meta-analysis. Twenty-two studies of wide excision had the lowest pooled recurrence rate at 8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 2%-16%); local excision had the highest at 34% (95% CI 24%-44%). For studies of wide/radical excision, flap repair had the lowest pooled recurrence rate at 0% (95% CI 0%-4%); delayed primary closure had the highest at 38% (95% CI 20%-59%). CONCLUSIONS Wide excision and flap-based reconstruction are associated with a lower postsurgical HS recurrence, although this must be balanced against potentially higher morbidity of extensive procedures. Heterogeneity and methodological limitations of the evidence limit the ability to make a strong conclusion about the relative recurrence rates associated with surgical techniques.

Moreover, in recent years, new infectious agents and diseases are being identified, and some diseases that were previously considered under control have reemerged. Furthermore, antimicrobial resistance has grown rapidly in a variety of hospital as well as community acquired infections. Thus, humanity still faces big challenges in the prevention and control of infectious diseases. Vaccination, generally considered to be the most effective method of preventing infectious diseases, works by presenting a foreign antigen to the immune system to evoke an immune response. The administered antigen can either be a live, but weakened, form of a pathogen (bacteria or virus), a killed or inactivated form of the pathogen, or a purified material such as a protein. However, no vaccine is completely safe; therefore, vaccine safety research and monitoring are necessary to minimize vaccine related harms. From the formulation point of view, the goal continues to be to improve the quality and global availability of vaccine delivery systems.

To characterize the time-dependent decline in humoral immunity, we performed a prospective cohort study measuring serial monthly semi-quantitative IgG antibody levels to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain in fully vaccinated in-center hemodialysis patients. Measurements were taken beginning at 2 months post full vaccination through 6 months after full vaccination. Early results showed similar seroconversion rates as prior studies with 88% obtaining positive antibody levels. Those with prior infection obtained the highest antibody levels. Over the ensuing months, patient antibody levels declined at an adjusted average rate of 31% per month. At the conclusion of the study, 40% of patients remaining in the cohort possessed either negative or borderline IgG antibody levels. Projecting future antibody levels based on the slopes of antibody level decay suggests 65% of the cohort will progress to borderline or negative antibody levels at 10 months post full vaccination.

Previous studies have shown that NIV effectiveness depends on patient adherence and tolerance. The aim of this study was to determine the adherence and efficacy of VAPS-NIV compared to spontaneous-time (S/T) mode in pediatric patients with neuromuscular disease (NMD). METHODS: This was a prospective observational study. Children with NMD who utilized NIV at home for ≥ 3 months were recruited from the Long-term ventilation clinic at The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada, from July 1, 2015, to July 1, 2019. Baseline characteristics, date of initiation of NIV, and pulmonary function tests were recorded. Polysomnogram (PSG) data and adherence were recorded and analyzed comparing VAPS and S/T modes. RESULTS: Twenty children with NMD (17 male, 85%) were enrolled. The mean (SD) age at initiation of NIV was 11.6 ± 4.6 years. The median (IQR) duration of ventilation was 1.36 (0.80–2.98) years. The mean average daily usage and the median daily usage for VAPS mode and S/T mode were 8.4 ± 1.6 versus 7.2 ± 2.5 h (p = 0.012) and 8.6 ± 1.4 versus 7.8 ± 2.1 h (p = 0.022), respectively. There was no difference in sleep architecture, gas exchange, or parent proxy report of NIV tolerance between S/T and VAPS modes. CONCLUSION: VAPS was associated with an improvement in adherence to therapy in children with NMD compared to S/T mode.

Methods: Data of 1087 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were collected from 49 sites between January 2 and February 28, 2020, in Sichuan and Wuhan. Patients were randomly categorized into the training and validation cohorts (7:3). The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and logistic regression analyzes were used to develop the nomogram. The performance of the nomogram was evaluated for the C-index, calibration, discrimination, and clinical usefulness. Further, the nomogram was externally validated in a different cohort. Results: The individualized prediction nomogram included 6 predictors: age, respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure, smoking status, fever, and chronic kidney disease. The model demonstrated a high discriminative ability in the training cohort (C-index = 0.829), which was confirmed in the external validation cohort (C-index = 0.776). In addition, the calibration plots confirmed good concordance for predicting the risk of ICU admission. Decision curve analysis revealed that the prediction nomogram was clinically useful.

These results suggest that a high viral load is a major feature of PRRSV-affected pigs. CONCLUSIONS: ZNA probe-based real-time PCR can be a useful tool to diagnose symptomatic and asymptomatic PRRSV-infected pigs. The presence of this marker in a sample of animals with high PRRSV loads (>10(4.2) PRRSV genomes/μl of serum) seems to indicate that it correlates with the presence of PRDC in pigs.",2013-09-12,"Lin, Chao-Nan; Lin, Wei-Hao; Hung, Li-Ning; Wang, Sheng-Yuan; Chiou, Ming-Tang",BMC Vet Res,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/112c03868171e79e5f64b72e7c837fd4875d88f4.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3847877.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3847877/,

dkwa2fje,,WHO,The Effect of Quarantine During the COVID-19 Pandemic on The Oral Health Habits of the Syrian Community,10.21203/rs.3.rs-1090420/v1,,,unk,"Introduction: Corona Virus appeared at the end of 2019. It belongs to a large family of viruses that can cause respiratory infections. Due to its ability to spread rapidly and easily, it has become a pandemic throughout almost the entire world. This has necessitated the establishment of quarantine procedures in order to reduce the rate of spread of the virus and thus the number of deaths. However, these procedures may cause a range of effects on people. One of the most important aspects that can be affected is oral health care. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of quarantine procedures on the oral health habits of the Syrian community. Materials: and methods: A survey was created using Google Forms and published on Facebook from 16 April 2020 until 11 May 2020. The number of people corresponding to the study criteria in Syria reached 1033. The survey looked at the effect of quarantine procedures on changing oral health habits, including the number of times of brushing and the time of brushing. Results: : Quarantine led to a change in oral health habits in 57.4% of the sample. Females were significantly more affected by changing habits during quarantine (P=0.020). The number of brushing times was not clearly affected and it was twice daily (49.4% before quarantine, 42.1% during quarantine). There was no statistically significant difference between the two periods in terms of the number of times of brushing. Conclusion: This study is the first study that showed the effect of home quarantine on the oral habits of members of the Syrian community. Home quarantine did not significantly affect the oral health habits of Syrians.",2021,"Kazwini, Rudwan Alawad Walaa Alhaffar M. H. D.

Systematic review.,,,33479973.0,unk,"OBJECTIVE To assess the effectiveness of Hand Hygiene (HH) in preventing infections and the transmission of pathogens, in an epidemic context, in community and hospital settings. METHOD It is a systematic review of the literature based on a document request, conducted on PubMed, using the following search equation: ""("" Hand Hygiene ""[All Fields] OR"" Hand Disinfection ""[All Fields]) AND (""Epidemics"" [All Fields] OR ""Pandemics"" [All Fields]) "". All publications related to the effectiveness of the preventive intervention for HH in an epidemic setting were Included. RESULTS A total of 16 publications were included, of which the majority proved the effectiveness of HH and its promotion in reducing infections during an epidemic. In a clinical trial, promoting HH in an intervention group significantly reduced the prevalence of infections (24.4% vs. 11.1%). Two systematic reviews have shown the effectiveness of HH in preventing the transmission of germs with ORs between 0.52 and 0.62. Four case-control studies and three cross-sectional studies concluded with the protective effect of HH with ORs varying between 0.06 and 0.71. A cohort study showed that low adherence to HH recommendations was associated with a higher infection rate (77.5% vs 95%; p = 0.02). A single systematic review did not conclude that HH was effective in the epidemic setting. CONCLUSION The effectiveness of HH in the fight against epidemics has been demonstrated.

In Brazil, this official recommendation lacks an economic evaluation. Our objective was to assess the efficiency of influenza A chemoprophylaxis in the Brazilian context. Methods: We assessed the cost-effectiveness of oseltamivir and zanamivir for prophylaxis of influenza for high risk population, compared to no prophylaxis, in the perspective of Brazilian public health system. Quality-adjusted life years (QALY) and effectiveness data were based on literature review and costs in Brazilian real (BRL) were estimated from official sources and micro-costing of 2016’s H1N1 admissions at a university hospital. We used a decision-tree model considering prophylaxis and no prophylaxis and the probabilities of H1N1, ambulatory care, admission to hospital, intensive care, patient discharge, and death. Adherence and adverse events from prophylaxis were included. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was converted to 2016 United States dollar (USD). Uncertainty was assessed with univariated and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Results: Adherence to prophylaxis was 0.70 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54; 0.83]; adverse events, 0.09 (95% CI 0.02; 0.18); relative risk of H1N1 infection in chemoprophylaxis, 0.43 (95% CI 0.33; 0.57); incidence of H1N1, 0.14 (95% CI 0.11; 0.16); ambulatory care, 0.67 (95% CI 0.58; 0.75); hospital admission, 0.43 (CI 95% 0.39; 0.42); hospital mortality, 0.14 (CI 95% 0.12; 0.15); intensive care unit admission, 0.23 (95% CI 0.20; 0.27); and intensive care mortality, 0.40 (95% CI 0.29; 0.52). QALY in H1N1 state was 0.50 (95% CI 0.46; 0.53); in H1N1 inpatients, 0.23 (95% CI 0.18; 0.28); healthy, 0.885 (95% CI 0.879; 0.891); death, 0. Adverse events estimated to affect QALY in –0.185 (95% CI –0.290; –0.050).

Therefore, vaccination needs to follow strict prioritization criteria. In this regard, almost all countries have prioritized similar classes of exposed workers: healthcare professionals and the elderly obtaining to maximize the survival of patients and years of life saved. Nevertheless, the virus is currently spreading at high rates, and any prioritization criterion so far adopted did not show to account for the topology of the contact networks. We consider that a network in which nodes are people while the edges represent their contacts may model the virus's spreading efficiently. In such a model, it is already known that spreading may be efficiently stopped by disconnecting the network, i.e., by vaccinating more central or relevant nodes, therefore, eliminating ""bridge edges"".

m9c4hyr9,,WHO,Investigating the status of prevention of coronavirus in industries,,,,unk,"Background and aims: Considering the high prevalence and lack of standard treatment for the new coronavirus, the best way in the current situation is to avoid infection and prevent its spread. In occupational environments, especially industries, due to air pollution with dust, gases and vapors and allergens and irritants, workers are susceptible to COVID-19 infection. Respiratory exposure of workers to these contaminants can adversely affect the function of their respiratory system and predispose them to respiratory diseases. In some industrial environments, due to the nature of work, workers are forced to work close to each other or use common tools and devices, thereby increasing the risk of the coronavirus outbreaks. Due to the high population density in factories and companies, it is necessary to study the prevention of the coronavirus and application of control measures. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the prevention of coronavirus in industry. Methods: This is a descriptive cross-sectional study that was performed after the pandemic of Covid-19 in April 2020. Three hundred and fifty Iranian industries were investigated in this study. In order to assess the status of Covid-19 prevention in industrial environments, a researcher-made questionnaire was used to perform the study. This study was conducted in three phases including checklist design, checklist validation and industry evaluation. The checklist questions were designed based on the latest recommendations offered by reputable international organizations. The initial questionnaire had 40 questions. To determine the validity, the questionnaire was checked carefully by a panel of experts, including 15 professors and experts in safety and emergency management. Content validity index (CVI) and content validity ratio (CVR) were also used to assess validity. Moreover, Cronbach's alpha coefficient was used to determine the reliability of the questionnaire. After designing and validating the checklist, in order to maintain ethical issues and prevent theCovid-19 outbreak the completion of the checklists' items, the checklists were prepared electronically and distributed in more than 50 social networks of occupational health professionals and HSE. The purpose of the study and how to answer the questions were fully explained to the occupational health and HSE officials. Next, the information was extracted and analyzed by SPSS software version 23. Results: After checking the validity of the designed checklist, 13 questions were removed and 27 questions remained in total. The results of face validity showed that the transparency, appropriateness and overall simplicity of the questionnaire were equal to 0.90, 0.93 and 0.91, respectively. The lowest and highest values of validity index were 0.79 and 1, respectively. Also, the minimum and maximum content validity ratios were, respectively, equal to 0.65 and 1. Total CVI and CVR values of the questionnaire were determined to be 0.87 and 0.92. Furthermore, based on the results of completed questionnaires by the industries, the Cronbach's alpha coefficient of the questionnaire was calculated to be 0.92. The findings of the evaluation showed that the commitment of management to the implementation of prevention programs in the industries is in good condition and most of the surveyed industries have a developed program to prevent of Covid-19. However, some areas such as telecommuting, distancing, and procuring some essential items were in poor condition. It was found that only 36.4% of the industries have taken action to strengthen local and general ventilation systems and more than 90% of them have held training programs for prevention. The most and the least supplied items were related to detergents (95.1%) and respirators (37.8%). Moreover, few industries have used the teleworking protocol (48.1%) and created an isolated room (26.1%) to isolate suspicious cases in emergencies. Conclusion: The results of this study showed that the designed checklist has a high reliability and can help the management of the rganization in assessing the current situation to manage the prevention of Covid-19. The results of the evaluation illustrated that the commitment of management to implement prevention programs in industries is in good condition and most of the industries surveyed have a developed program to combat Covid-19. However, some areas, such as teleworking, spacing, and the provision of some essential items, were in an unfavorable position, requiring the strengthening of discovered weaknesses. © 2020 Iran University of Medical Sciences.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: To better understand barriers, focus groups were conducted in Florida and California with adults ≥18 years old with type 1 diabetes with selection criteria including hospitalization for diabetic ketoacidosis, HbA(1c) >9%, and/or receiving care at a Federally Qualified Health Center. Sixteen focus groups were conducted in English or Spanish with 86 adults (mean age 42 ± 16.2 years). Transcript themes and pre–focus group demographic survey data were analyzed.

This idea can be presented to users of the app as counting points. One point represents some constant probability, $p_\text{point}$, of infection. Then the app would work in a similar way to a calorie counting app (instead of counting calories we count probability increments of being infected). Government could set a maximum recommended number of daily (or weekly) points available to each user in accord with its objectives (bringing the disease under control, allowing essential workers to work, protecting vulnerable individuals, ...). It is posited that this, along with other proposed ""levers"" would allow government to manage a gradual transition to normalcy. I discuss a circuit framework with wires running between boxes. In this framework the wires represent possible sources of infection, namely individuals and the venues themselves (through deposits of pathogens left at the venue). The boxes represent interactions of these sources (when individuals visit a venue). This circuit framework allows (i) calculation of points cost for visiting venues and (ii) probabilistic contact tracing.

Taking advantage of versatility and rapid development, three SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine candidates have entered clinical trials with a two-dose immunization regimen. However, the waning antibody response in convalescent patients after SARS-CoV-2 infection and the emergence of human re-infection have raised widespread concerns about a possible short duration of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine protection. Here, we developed a nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccine in lipid-encapsulated form that encoded the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, termed as mRNA-RBD. A single immunization of mRNA-RBD elicited both robust neutralizing antibody and cellular responses, and conferred a near-complete protection against wild SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lungs of hACE2 transgenic mice. Noticeably, the high levels of neutralizing antibodies in BALB/c mice induced by mRNA-RBD vaccination were maintained for at least 6.5 months and conferred a long-term notable protection for hACE2 transgenic mice against SARS-CoV-2 infection in a sera transfer study.

With shortage of kits, and deadly underlying disease due to its vastly mutating and contagious properties, the tired physicians need a fast diagnostic method to cater the requirements of the soaring number of infected patients. Laboratory testing has turned out to be an arduous, cost-ineffective and requiring a well-equipped laboratory for analysis. This paper proposes a convolutional neural network (CNN) based model for analysis/detection of COVID-19, dubbed as CovCNN, which uses the patient’s chest X-ray images for the diagnosis of COVID-19 with an aim to assist the medical practitioners to expedite the diagnostic process amongst high workload conditions. In the proposed CovCNN model, a novel deep-CNN based architecture has been incorporated with multiple folds of CNN. These models utilize depth wise convolution with varying dilation rates for efficiently extracting diversified features from chest X-rays. 657 chest X-rays of which 219 were X-ray images of patients infected from COVID-19 and the remaining were the images of non-COVID-19 (i.e. normal or COVID-19 negative) patients. Further, performance evaluation on the dataset using different pre-trained models has been analyzed based on the loss and accuracy curve. The experimental results show that the highest classification accuracy (98.4%) is achieved using the proposed CovCNN model.",2021-09-08,"Sanket, Shashwat; Vergin Raja Sarobin, M.; Jani Anbarasi, L.; Thakor, Jayraj; Singh, Urmila; Narayanan, Sathiya",Multimed Tools Appl,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/1a1bdf5de19126442097e5d22d975a831f167579.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8423603.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34512112/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11042-021-11257-5,237453046.0

bnud0ipa,,WHO,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on management and outcomes in acute appendicitis: Should these new practices be the norm?,,,,unk,"BACKGROUND: In early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic significantly altered management of surgical patients globally. International guidelines recommended that non-operative management be implemented wherever possible (e.g. in proven uncomplicated appendicitis) to reduce pressure on healthcare services and reduce risk of peri-operative viral transmission. We sought to compare our management and outcomes of appendicitis during lockdown vs a non-pandemic period. METHODS: All presentations to our department with a clinical diagnosis of acute appendicitis between 12/03/2020 and 30/06/2020 were compared to the same 110-day period in 2019. Quantity and severity of presentations, use of radiological investigations, rate of operative intervention and histopathological findings were variables collected for comparison. RESULTS: There was a reduction in appendicitis presentations (from 74 to 56 cases), and an increase in radiological imaging (from 70.27% to 89.29%) (P = 0.007) from 2019 to 2020. In 2019, 93.24% of patients had appendicectomy, compared to 71.42% in 2020(P < 0.001). This decrease was most pronounced in uncomplicated cases, whose operative rates dropped from 90.32% to 62.5% (P = 0.009). Post-operative histology confirmed appendicitis in 73.9% in 2019, compared to 97.5% in 2020 (P = 0.001). Normal appendiceal pathology was reported for 17 cases (24.64%) in 2019, compared to none in 2020 (P < 0.001) - a 0% negative appendicectomy rate (NAR). DISCUSSION: The 0% NAR in 2020 is due to a combination of increased CT imaging, a higher threshold to operate, and is impacted by increased disease severity due to delayed patient presentation. This study adds to growing literature promoting routine use of radiological imaging to confirm appendicitis diagnosis. As we enter a second lockdown, patients should be encouraged to avoid late presentations, and surgical departments should continue using radiological imaging more liberally in guiding appendicitis management.",2021,"Somers, Kate; Abd Elwahab, Sami; Raza, Muhammad Zeeshan; O039,; Grady, Sorcha; DeMarchi, Joshua; Butt, Abeeda; Burke, John; Robb, William; Power, Colm; McCawley, Niamh; McNamara, Deborah; Kearney, David; Hill, Arnold D K",Surg.

However, issues including the emergence of drug resistance, toxicity, and coinfections have posed new challenges for nucleoside-based antiviral drug discovery, particularly in the era of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Chemical manipulation could impact the antiviral potency, safety, and drug resistance of nucleosides. Generally, modified nucleosides are difficult to recognize by intracellular important enzymes as substrates and thus exhibit low toxicity. 4'-Modified nucleosides represent an important subclass of modified nucleosides for antiviral therapies. To prevent the occurrence of drug resistance, 4'-modified nucleosides should have 3'-OH, which should also be chemically unreactive for proviral DNA biosynthesis. The absence of 3'-OH may explain the occurrence of drug resistance for censavudine. The introduction of 4'-substituents improves enzymatic and acidic stability and makes the nucleosides more lipophilic, thus improving cell permeability and bioavailability. Steric hindrance between the 4'-substituent and 3'-OH changes the furanose conformation to the 3'-endo type, in which the oxygen lone pair on the furanose ring could not form an oxocarbonium ion for glycolysis. Currently, seven 4'-modified nucleoside drug candidates such as azvudine (also known as FNC), islatravir, censavudine, balapiravir, lumicitabine, AL-335, and 4-azidothymidine have progressed into clinical stages for treating viral infections. Of note, FNC was officially approved by NMPA in July 2021 for use in adult patients with high HIV-1 virus loads (nos. H20210035 and H20210036), providing an alternative therapeutic for patients with HIV-1. The long-term cellular retention of FNC suggests its potential as a long-lasting pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) agent for preventing HIV-1 infection. Mechanistically, FNC not only inhibited HIV-1 reverse transcription and replication but also restored A3G expression in peripheral blood CD4+ T cells in HIV-1 patients receiving FNC. The 4'-azido group in azvudine stabilizes the 3'-C-endo (north) conformation by steric effects and the formation of an intramolecular hydrogen bond with the 3'-OH group, thus decreasing the nucleophilicity of 3'-OH. The north conformation may also enhance the phosphorylation efficiency of FNC by cellular kinases. Encouragingly, FNC, islatravir, and balapiravir show promise for the treatment of coronaviruses, of which FNC has advanced to phase 3 clinical trials in different countries to treat patients with COVID-19 (clinical trial numbers: NCT04668235 and NCT04425772). FNC cured the COVID-19 disease in almost all patients and showed better therapeutic efficacy than remdesivir. In this Account, we provide an overview of 4'-modified nucleoside analogs in clinical stages for antiviral therapies, highlighting the drug discovery strategies, structure-activity relationship studies, and preclinical/clinical studies and also give our perspectives on nucleoside-based antiviral drug discovery.",2022-01-25,"Chang, Junbiao",Accounts of chemical research,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.accounts.1c00697; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35077644/,246286383.0

We present the first case in the literature of craniectomy procedure and asportation of a solitary cerebellar metastasis of the oesophagus squamous carcinoma in a 77 years old woman COVID-19 positive. In these particular circumstances, we show that adequate healthcare resources and risk assessments are essential in the management of COVID-19 patients referred to emergency surgery. PRESENTATION OF CASE: The case here presented was treated in 2019 for squamous carcinoma of the oesophagus. In April 2020, she presented a deterioration of her clinical picture consisting of dysphagia, abdominal pain, hyposthenia and ataxia. A Head CT scan was performed, which showed the presence of a solitary cerebellar metastasis. Her associated SARS-CoV-2 positivity status represented the principal clinical concern throughout her hospitalisation. DISCUSSION: The patient underwent a suboccipital craniectomy procedure with metastasis asportation. She tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the pre- and post-operative phases, but she was not admitted to the intensive care unit because she did not present any respiratory complications. Her vital parameters and inflammation indexes fell within the reference ranges, and she was kept in isolation for 16 days in our neurosurgical unit following strict COVID-19 measures. She was asymptomatic and not treated for any of the specific and non-specific symptoms of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: This is the first case reported of solitary cerebellar metastasis of oesophagus carcinoma operated on a COVID-19 positive patient. It shows that asymptomatic COVID-19 positive patients can undergo major emergency surgeries without the risk of infecting the operating team if adequate Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) is used. The patient remained asymptomatic and did not develop the disease’s active phase despite undergoing a stressful event such as a major emergency neurosurgical procedure. In the current crisis, a prophylactic COVID-19 screening test can identify asymptomatic patients undergoing major emergency surgery and adequate resource planning and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for healthcare workers can minimise the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic.",2020-11-21,"Lapolla, Pierfrancesco; Familiari, Pietro; Bruzzaniti, Placido; Arcese, Roberto; Matassa, Roberto; Frati, Alessandro; D’Andrea, Giancarlo; Santoro, Antonio",Int J Surg Case Rep,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/805703316db34e536f9478badca6f765b69f9405.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7679517.xml.json,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210261220311275?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2210261220311275; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijscr.2020.11.102; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33251091/,227075611.0

(J Econom 209:185–207, 2019. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2018.12.022) and Phillips and Sul (Econometrica 75:1771–1855, 2007. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-0262.2007.00811.x) approaches. Moreover, club convergence analysis was carried out in four different configurations, varying in the technique of trend component extraction from the data. In particular, three well-known methods of time series decomposition were used, i.e. the Hodrick–Prescott, Butterworth and Christiano–Fitzgerald filters, as well as the most recent boosted Hodrick–Prescott filter. The results indicated that rental prices across the studied cities do not share a common path in the long run. It is possible, however, to identify convergence clubs where rents are moving towards a club-specific steady state. Detailed analysis of the structure of estimated clusters showed that data filtering using the boosted Hodrick–Prescott method leads to the most reliable allocation of cities to convergence clubs. Moreover, the estimation of logit models revealed that the likelihood of any two cities belonging to the same convergence club depends mainly on similar levels in terms of the unemployment rate, housing stock, city area, and the number of students. Finally, recommendations for local and national policy-makers concerning the development of the rental market have been formulated, particularly in the areas of urban land-use planning policy, housing legislation and public–private partnerships.",2021-06-06,"Tomal, Mateusz",Empir Econ,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/762c6525fe3a9612197018dcbecc7313d1c7a714.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8179960.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34121800/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00181-021-02080-w,235371931.0

COVID-19 pandemic is spreading all over the world with the number of infected cases increased to 54.4 million with 1.32 million deaths. Different types of statistical models have been developed to predict viral infection and multiple studies have compared the performance of these predictive models, but results were not consistent. This study aimed to develop and provide easy to use model to predict the Covid-19 infection severity in the patients and to help understanding the patient's condition. METHODS: This study analyzed simulated data obtained from the large database for 340 patients with an active Covid-19 infection. The study identified predictors of Covid-19 outcomes that may be measured in two different ways: the total T-cell levels in the blood with T-cell subsets and number of cells in the blood infected with virus. All measures are relatively unobtrusive as they only require a blood sample, however there is a significant laboratory cost implications for measuring the number of cells infected with virus. This study used methodological approach using two different methods showing how multiple regression and logistic regression can be used in the context of Covid-19 longitudinal data to develop the prediction models. RESULTS: This study has identified the predictors of Covid-19 infection outcomes and developed prediction models. In the regression model of Total_T Cell, the predictors BMI, comorbidity and Total_Tcell were all associated with increased levels of infection severity (p < 0.001). For BMI, the mean % of unhealthy cells increased by 0.42 (95% CI 0.24 to 0.60) and comorbidity predictor has on average 8.3% more unhealthy liver cells than without comorbidity (95% CI - 2.9%-1.29%). The results of multivariate logistic regression model predicting the Covid-19 Infection severity were promising. The significant predictors were observed such as Age (OR 0.95, p = 0.02, 95% CI: 0.91-0.99), Helper T_cells (OR O.93, p = 0.03, 95% CI: 0.87-0.99), Basic_Tcell (OR 1.11, p = 0.001, 95% CI: 1.06-1.71) and Comorbidity (OR 0.41, p = 0.05, 95% CI: 0.16-1.07). CONCLUSIONS: In this study recommendation has been provided to clinical researchers on the best way to use the various Covid-19 infections measures along with identifying other possible predictors of Covid-19 infection.

Orthopaedic surgeons are at risk of contracting COVID-19 due to their close contact with patients in both outpatient and theatre environments. The aim of this review was to perform a literature review, including articles of other coronaviruses, to formulate guidelines for orthopaedic healthcare staff. METHODS: A search of Medline, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, World Health Organization (WHO), and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) databases was performed encompassing a variety of terms including ‘coronavirus’, ‘covid-19’, ‘orthopaedic’, ‘personal protective environment’ and ‘PPE’. Online database searches identified 354 articles. Articles were included if they studied any of the other coronaviruses or if the basic science could potentially applied to COVID-19 (i.e. use of an inactivated virus with a similar diameter to COVID-19). Two reviewers independently identified and screened articles based on the titles and abstracts. 274 were subsequently excluded, with 80 full-text articles retrieved and assessed for eligibility. Of these, 66 were excluded as they compared personal protection equipment to no personal protection equipment or referred to prevention measures in the context of bacterial infections. RESULTS: There is a paucity of high quality evidence surrounding COVID-19. This review collates evidence from previous coronavirus outbreaks to put forward recommendations for orthopaedic surgeons during the COVID-19 pandemic. The key findings have been summarized and interpreted for application to the orthopaedic operative setting. CONCLUSION: For COVID-19 positive patients, minimum suggested PPE includes N95 respirator, goggles, face shield, gown, double gloves, and surgical balaclava. Space suits not advised. Be trained in the correct technique of donning and doffing PPE. Use negative pressure theatres if available. Minimize aerosolization and its effects (smoke evacuation and no pulse lavage).

We sought to understand intergenerational differences in the impact of the initial COVID-19 restrictions on interactions, loneliness, and stress. Data was collected via online survey from individuals ages 18 and above during the period April 7-May 8, 2020. The predominantly female, White, and well-educated sample (n = 962) included 245 younger adults (YAs) ages 18-34, 374 middle-aged adults (MAs) ages 35-64, and 343 older adults (OAs) ages 65+, with overall mean age 51.67 (SD=20.257; range 18-96). Before the restrictions, 41% of these OAs infrequently/never interacted face-to-face with children, increasing to 74% after restrictions. Three quarters (77%) of YAs reported seeing OAs less often, but 42% reported increasing their connections with OAs via technology.

The aim of this study was to conduct a population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) analysis of rivaroxaban in Chinese patients with NVAF to assess ethnic differences and provide model-based precision dosing. A total of 256 rivaroxaban plasma concentrations and 244 prothrombin time (PT) measurements were obtained from 195 Chinese NVAF patients from a prospective clinical trial. The population PK-PD model was developed using nonlinear mixed effects modeling (NONMEM) software. The PK of rivaroxaban was adequately described using a one-compartment model with first-order adsorption and elimination. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was identified as a major covariate for apparent clearance. No single nucleotide polymorphism was identified as a significant covariate. PT exhibited a linear relationship with rivaroxaban concentration. Total bilirubin (TBIL) and eGFR were identified as significant covariates for baseline PT. According to the Monte Carlo simulation, 15 mg for Chinese patients with eGFR ≥50 mL/min and normal liver function yielded an exposure comparable to 20 mg for Caucasian patients. Patients with moderately impaired renal function may require a lower dose of rivaroxaban to avoid overexposure. Moreover, there was an approximate 26% increase in PT levels in patients with TBIL of 34 µmol/L and eGFR of 30 mL/min, which could increase the risk of major bleeding.

This study analyzed the characteristics of caregiver use and caregiving costs among elderly patients hospitalized due to acute illness or exacerbation of chronic diseases. METHODS A total of 819 study participants were selected from the 2017 Korea Health Panel Study Data. Replacement costing methods were applied to estimate the hours of informal caregiver assistance received by elderly inpatients. Elderly inpatients' predisposing, enabling, and need factors were studied to identify the relationship between caregiver uses, based on Andersen's behavior model. A two-part model was applied to analyze the factors related to care receipt and to estimate the incremental costs of care. RESULTS Elderly inpatients who used tertiary hospitals (OR: 2.77, p-value < 0.00) and received financial support (OR: 2.68, p-value < 0.00) were more likely to receive support from a caregiver. However, elderly inpatients living alone were lesser to do so (OR: 0.49, p-value < 0.00). Elderly inpatients with Medicaid insurance (β:0.54, p-value = 0.02) or financial aid (β: 0.64, p-value < 0.00) had a statistically positive association with spending more on caregiving costs. Additionally, financial support receivers had incremental costs of $627 in caregiving costs than nonreceivers. CONCLUSIONS This study presented significant socioenvironmental characteristics of formal and informal caregiver use and the related expenditures. Healthcare management plans that encompass multiple social levels should be implemented to ease the caregiver burden.

uxls14rx,,WHO,Gradient supercritical fluid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry with a gradient flow of make-up solvent for enantioseparation of cathinones,,,,unk,"In the past two decades, supercritical fluid chromatography has evolved from a niche application to a comprehensive technology and a fully-fledged alternative to conventional high-performance liquid chromatography. In this study, we have focused on chiral separation of synthetic cathinones in gradient supercritical fluid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry using an inverse gradient of a make-up solvent. Synthetic cathinones possess an amphetamine-like effect and, therefore, are frequently being offered on the Internet as a replacement for illicit drugs. Cathinones are chiral compounds, however, they are usually marketed and used as racemic mixtures. Since the effect of individual enantiomers can significantly vary, there is a need for the development of enantioseparation methods enabling to study the biological effects of individual enantiomers. Since cathinones are basic molecules, they are easily protonated (positively charged) under weakly acidic mobile phase conditions, which is a typical feature of supercritical mobile phases with an alcohol as an organic modifier. The positively charged species represent ideal analytes for ion exchangers, such as chiral zwitterion ion exchangers Chiralpak ZWIX (+) and Chiralpak ZWIX (-), which possess a positively and negatively charged unit in the molecular structure of the selectors. The presence of the positive charge in the selector's structure, functioning as a counter-ion for the positively charged analytes, significantly reduces the required amount of a buffer, which is plausible for hyphenation of such a separation system with mass spectrometry. For mass spectrometry hyphenated to supercritical fluid chromatography, the use of a make-up solvent is required to avoid analyte precipitation when using a low concentration of an organic co-solvent (modifier) in the super-/subcritical mobile phase. Hereby, we introduce a unique approach, which is based on the gradient introduction of the make-up to the post-column effluent. Using this approach, it is possible to keep constant the overall amount of the organic solvent (modifier and make-up) introduced into the mass spectrometer when using a gradient of the organic modifier. We show that the developed gradient elution method facilitates the chiral separation of all employed analytes, while the mobile-phase gradient compensation by the inverse make-up gradient enables their detection with high signal intensities.",2020,"Kolderová, Natalie; Jurásek, Bronislav; Kuchar, Martin; Lindner, Wolfgang; Kohout, Michal",J Chromatogr A,,#32709336,,,,,219907771.0

Gitelman syndrome (GS) is an inherited salt-losing renal tubulopathy characterized by hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis with hypomagnesemia and hypocalciuria.

GS has been described in association with thyroid disorders and should be considered in patients with hyperthyroidism and persistent hypokalemia, especially in those with associated hypomagnesemia and hypocalciuria. Case summary. In this report, we describe an 18-year-old female who presented with hyperemesis gravidarum and thyrotoxicosis, and was incidentally found to have GS, confirmed by the sequence analysis of SLC12A3. Conclusions. Thyroid dysfunctions, such as hypothyroidism, thyrotoxicosis, and thyroid nodules, may develop during pregnancy. A structural homology between the beta-human chorionic gonadotropin and thyroid stimulating hormone molecules, as well as their receptors is probably the basis for the transient thyrotoxicosis crisis during pregnancy.

Immunoglobulin M (IgM) responses were either found earlier than IgG, or together with IgG, later than IgG, or were missing. Therefore, clear distinctions between early, intermediate, and past infections are obviously not possible merely on the basis of IgM and IgG determinations. A review of publications on the serology of other virus groups shows that variable IgM responses can be found as well and therefore are not unique for SARS-CoV-2 infections. A model to explain this variability is proposed. The inclusion of avidity determination into regular diagnostic procedures has allowed to resolve such ""atypical"" serological constellations. The potential use of avidity determination for the diagnosis of COVID-19, for risk assessment, epidemiological studies, analysis of cross reactions, as well as for the control of vaccination programs is suggested and discussed.",2020,"Bauer, Georg",J. med. virol,,#633787,,,,,220389586.0

Factors influencing dietary intake among the diverse African populations are not well understood. Our objective was to characterize the dietary intake and their determinants in the two main ethnic groups experiencing nutrition transition in Cameroon, the Bamiléké and the Béti. We sampled Bamiléké (381) and Béti (347) adults living in both rural and urban, collected sociodemographic variables, assessed dietary patterns by using a food portion photographs book to administrate a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and a 24-hour dietary recall technique, and derived their Body Mass Index (BMI) from measured weight and height. The dietary patterns of Bamiléké people were comprised of more energy-dense foods than the Béti people, regardless of the living area. The energy intake (13·8 (SD 4·6)-15·4 (SD 4·8) MJ vs 9·7 (SD 3·5)-11·2 (SD 3·9 MJ) and the obesity (15-29 % vs 5-8 %) were therefore higher in Bamiléké than in Béti respectively.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Study sample consisted of 80 patients diagnosed as COVID-19 from January to February 2020. The chest CT images and clinical data were reviewed, and the relationship between them was analyzed. RESULTS: Totally, 80 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were included. With regards to the clinical manifestations, 58 (73%) of the 80 patients had cough, and 61 (76%) of the 80 patients had high temperature levels. The most frequent CT abnormalities observed were ground glass opacity (73/80 cases, 91%), consolidation (50/80 cases, 63%), and interlobular septal thickening (47/80, 59%). Most of the lesions were multiple, with an average of 12 ± 6 lung segments involved. The most common involved lung segments were the dorsal segment of the right lower lobe (69/80, 86%), the posterior basal segment of the right lower lobe (68/80, 85%), the lateral basal segment of the right lower lobe (64/80, 80%), the dorsal segment of the left lower lobe (61/80, 76%), and the posterior basal segment of the left lower lobe (65/80, 81%). The average pulmonary inflammation index value was (34% ± 20%) for all the patients. Correlation analysis showed that the pulmonary inflammation index value was significantly correlated with the values of lymphocyte count, monocyte count, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, days from illness onset, and body temperature (P < 0.05).

Sevoflurane has neuroprotective properties in vitro and in animal models. This study was designed to determine cognitive and clinical outcomes after sevoflurane- compared with propofol-based anaesthesia for on-pump cardiac surgery and the impact of decreases in under different anaesthesia regimens. METHODS One hundred and twenty-eight patients were randomly assigned to either i.v. anaesthesia with propofol- (PROP) or sevoflurane-based anaesthesia (SEVO). An intraoperative was defined as desaturation. The Abbreviated Mental Test, Stroop Test, Trail-Making Test, Word Lists, and mood-assessment tests were performed before, 2, 4, and 6 days after cardiac surgery. Markers of general outcome were obtained. RESULTS The analysis groups had differences in baseline cognitive performance. Analysis of variance for repeated measures (incorporating covariance of baseline scores) showed that in three of four cognitive tests, patients with cerebral desaturation showed worse results than patients without desaturation. Patients assigned to sevoflurane-based anaesthesia showed better results in all cognitive tests than patients after propofol.

Indian patients with HNSCC are mostly associated with tobacco usage and may have different genetic alterations compared with Western patients who are mostly associated with human papillomavirus infection. Polymorphisms in DNA repair genes are correlated to individuals' susceptibility and progression of cancer. XRCC1 is a DNA repair enzyme. Materials and Methods In the present prospective study, Indian population of HNSCC patients (n = 45) were screened for Arg399Gln variant of XRCC1 using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism technique, prospective evaluation of the patients was done after treatment, and the single-nucleotide polymorphism results were correlated to survival functions. Results Out of 45 patients, 28 patients were Arg/Arg, 12 patients were Arg/Gln, and 5 patients were Gln/Gln. Overall survival for the entire cohort and Arg/Arg, Arg/Gln, and Gln/Gln cohort was 36.3 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 33-39.5), 38.6 (95% CI: 35.3-41.9), 35.8 (95% CI: 28.6-42.9), and 26.4 (95% CI: 13.7-39.1) months (P = 0.097), respectively. Progression-free survival (PFS) of the entire patient cohort and Arg/Arg, Arg/Gln, and Gln/Gln cohort was 35.2 (95% CI: 31.4-39.1), 38.2 (95% CI: 34.3-42.1), 32.7 (95% CI: 26.2-39.1), and 22.3 (95% CI: 9.4-35.3) (P = 0.061), respectively.

2afbqkdo,,WHO,Everyday moral decision-making after acute stress exposure: do social closeness and timing matter?,,,,unk,"There is increasing empirical evidence that social distance and timing affect prosocial behavior after acute stress exposure. The present study focused on everyday moral decision-making after acute psychosocial stress and how it is influenced by effects of social closeness and timing. We exposed 40 young healthy men to the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST, n = 20) or its non-stressful placebo version (PTSST, n = 20). Moral decision-making was assessed early (+10 until +30 min) and late (+75 until +95 min) after (P)TSST exposure by the Everyday Moral Conflict Situations (EMCS) Scale. The EMCS Scale requests altruistic versus egoistic responses to everyday moral conflict situations with varying closeness of target persons. Results revealed significantly higher total percentages of altruistic decisions in the stress than in the control condition and for scenarios involving socially close (e.g., mother) versus socially distant (e.g., stranger) protagonists, while the main effect of timing was nonsignificant. Only secondary analyses showed increased altruistic decision-making after acute stress exposure toward socially close but not toward distant protagonists at the early but not at the late point of measurement. Moreover, psychological stress responses and personality traits were significantly associated with EMCS scores. Positive correlations between cortisol levels and altruistic decision-making were descriptively observable, but did not reach statistical significance. In sum, our findings suggest increased altruistic decision-making toward socially close compared to socially distant protagonists and provide further evidence that acute stress influences decision-making in everyday moral conflict scenarios in a prosocial manner. Lay summary In order to investigate the effects of acute stress on everyday moral decision-making, 40 young healthy men were exposed to moderate psychosocial stress by the use of the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) or its non-stressful placebo version and then completed a hypothetical everyday moral decision-making paradigm. Our findings provide evidence that acute stress exposure influences decision-making in everyday moral conflict situations in a prosocial manner. Furthermore, participants decided more altruistically in scenarios involving socially close (e.g., mother) versus socially distant (e.g., stranger) protagonists.",2020,"Singer, Nina; Binapfl, Julia; Sommer, Monika; Wüst, Stefan; Kudielka, Brigitte M",Stress,,#33138682,,,,,226241773.0

But it is not clear whether endometriosis increases the risk of COVID-19. METHODS: Women who referred to the gynecology clinic were evaluated and 507 women with endometriosis (case group) were compared with 520 women without endometriosis (control group). COVID-19 infection, symptoms, exposure, hospitalization, isolation, H1N1 infection and vaccination, and past medical history of the participants were recorded and compared between the groups using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows version 21. RESULTS: Comparison between the groups represent COVID-19 infection in 3.2% of the case group and 3% of the control group (P = 0.942). The control group had a higher frequency of asymptomatic infection (95.7% vs. 94.5%; P < 0.001) and fever (1.6% vs. 0%; P = 0.004), while the frequency of rare symptoms was more common in the case group (P < 0.001). The average disease period was 14 days in both groups (P = 0.694). COVID-19 infection was correlated with close contact (r = 0.331; P < 0.001 in the case group and r = 0.244; P < 0.001 in the control group), but not with the history of thyroid disorders, H1N1 vaccination, traveling to high-risk areas, and social isolation (P > 0.05).

agl8q0p0,,WHO,On the Role of Multi-Objective Optimization to the Transit Network Design Problem (preprint)/ en,,,,unk,"Ongoing traffic changes, including those triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, reveal the necessity to adapt our public transport systems to the ever-changing users' needs. This work shows that single and multi objective stances can be synergistically combined to better answer the transit network design problem (TNDP). Single objective formulations are dynamically inferred from the rating of networks in the approximated (multi-objective) Pareto Front, where a regression approach is used to infer the optimal weights of transfer needs, times, distances, coverage, and costs. As a guiding case study, the solution is applied to the multimodal public transport network in the city of Lisbon, Portugal. The system takes individual trip data given by smartcard validations at CARRIS buses and METRO subway stations and uses them to estimate the origin-destination demand in the city. Then, Genetic Algorithms are used, considering both single and multi objective approaches, to redesign the bus network that better fits the observed traffic demand. The proposed TNDP optimization proved to improve results, with reductions in objective functions of up to 28.3%. The system managed to extensively reduce the number of routes, and all passenger related objectives, including travel time and transfers per trip, significantly improve. Grounded on automated fare collection data, the system can incrementally redesign the bus network to dynamically handle ongoing changes to the city traffic.",,"Silva, Vasco Finamore Anna Henriques Rui",,,#ppcovidwho-326403,,,,,246294836.0

METHODS: The clinical characteristics and microbiological results of 181 patients caused by CRO infection treated with polymyxin B in the First Affiliated Hospital from July 2018 to May 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. The bacterial clearance rate, clinical efficacy, adverse drug reactions and 28 days mortality were evaluated. RESULTS: The overall effective rate of 181 patients was 49.72%, the total bacterial clearance rate was 42.0%, and the 28 day all-cause mortality rate was 59.1%. The effective rate and bacterial clearance rate in the group of less than 24 h from the isolation of CRO to the use of polymyxin B were significantly higher than those in the group of more than 24 h. Logistics multivariate regression analysis showed that the predictive factors for effective treatment of CRO with polymyxin B were APACHEII score, duration of polymyxin B treatment, combination of polymyxin B and other antibiotics, and bacterial clearance. 17 cases (9.36%) of acute kidney injury were considered as polymyxin B nephrotoxicity and 4 cases (23.5%) recovered after polymyxin B withdrawal. After 14 days of polymyxin B use, 3 cases of polymyxin B resistance appeared, and there were 2 cases of polymyxin B resistance in the daily dose 1.5 mg/kg/day group. CONCLUSION: For CRO infection, the treatment of polymyxin B should be early, combined, optimal dose and duration of treatment, which can achieve better clinical efficacy and microbial reactions, and reduce the adverse reactions and drug resistance.",2021-10-04,"Xia, G.

WHO responded quickly to this multi-country outbreak and on 12 March released a “global alert” about SARS. This was followed by the first WHO travel advisory on 15 March. The Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network was activated, and international experts were brought together to implement enhanced global surveillance systems for SARS. The international community has learned a lot of lessons from the SARS outbreak. Particularly, rapid and transparent information sharing between countries is critical to prevent international spread of the disease. However, information exchange was less than optimal in the early phase of the outbreak.",2005-09-01,"Oshitani, Hitoshi",Environmental Health and Preventive Medicine,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/85ece9f1023725b3ec39debf92766abf64adb03f.json,,https://environhealthprevmed.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1007/BF02897698; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21432127/; https://doi.org/10.1007/bf02897698,46015769.0

However, in the lack of appropriate immunocompetent small animal models, mechanistic insight in YF17D-induced protective immunity remains limited. To better understand YF17D vaccination and to identify a suitable mouse model, we evaluated the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of YF17D in five complementary mouse models, i.e. wild-type (WT) BALB/c, C57BL/6, IFN-α/β receptor (IFNAR(-/-)) deficient mice, and in WT mice in which type I IFN signalling was temporally ablated by an IFNAR blocking (MAR-1) antibody. Alike in IFNAR(-/-) mice, YF17D induced in either WT mice strong humoral immune responses dominated by IgG2a/c isotype (Th1 type) antibodies, yet only when IFNAR was blocked. Vigorous cellular immunity characterized by CD4(+) T-cells producing IFN-γ and TNF-α were mounted in MAR-1 treated C57BL/6 and in IFNAR(-/-) mice. Surprisingly, vaccine-induced protection was largely mouse model dependent. Full protection against lethal intracranial challenge and a massive reduction of virus loads was conferred already by a minimal dose of 2 PFU YF17D in BALB/c and IFNAR(-/-) mice, but not in C57BL/6 mice. Correlation analysis of infection outcome with pre-challenge immunological markers indicates that YFV-specific IgG might suffice for protection, even in the absence of detectable levels of neutralizing antibodies. Finally, we propose that, in addition to IFNAR(-/-) mice, C57BL/6 mice with temporally blocked IFN-α/β receptors represent a promising immunocompetent mouse model for the study of YF17D-induced immunity and evaluation of YF17D-derived vaccines.",2021-12-02,"Ma, Ji; Boudewijns, Robbert; Sanchez-Felipe, Lorena; Mishra, Niraj; Vercruysse, Thomas; Buh Kum, Dieudonné; Thibaut, Hendrik Jan; Neyts, Johan; Dallmeier, Kai",,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/a0ab98159963136af6b81ccf4d96964b91ef04df.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8648041.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8648041/,

The aim of this study was to describe the most common imaging features of MIS-C associated with SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: A retrospective review was made of the medical records and radiological imaging studies of 47 children (26 male, 21 female) in the age range of 25 months–15 years who were diagnosed with MIS-C between August 2020 and March 2021. Chest radiographs were available for all 47 patients, thorax ultrasound for 6, chest CT for 4, abdominal ultrasound for 42, abdomen CT for 9, neck ultrasound for 4, neck CT for 2, brain CT for 1, and brain MRI for 3. RESULTS: The most common finding on chest radiographs was perihilar–peribronchial thickening (46%). The most common findings on abdominal ultrasonography were mesenteric inflammation (42%), and hepatosplenomegaly (38%, 28%). Lymphadenopathy was determined in four patients who underwent neck ultrasound, one of whom had deep neck infection on CT. One patient had restricted diffusion and T2 hyperintensity involving the corpus callosum splenium on brain MRI, and one patient had epididymitis related with MIS-C. CONCLUSION: Pulmonary manifestations are uncommon in MIS-C. In the abdominal imaging, mesenteric inflammation, hepatosplenomegaly, periportal edema, ascites and bowel wall thickening are the most common findings.

AIM OF THE STUDY: A Mongolian folk medicinal plant named Thalictrum minus L. (TML) has been extensively used for the treatment of lung inflammation, bacterial and fungal infection and tuberculosis. Our present study aims to investigate the effectiveness of TML against particulate matter (PM)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) and the potential underlying mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Initially, HPLC-Q-TOF was applied for the qualitative analysis and HPLC was used for quantitative analysis of main components in TML. Then, the mice model of ALI was induced by PM via intratracheally instilled with 50 mg/kg body weight of Standard Reference Material1648a (SRM1648a), and TML (10, 20, 40 mg/kg) were administered orally 1 h prior to PM. The efficacy and molecular mechanisms in the presence or absence of TML were elucidated. RESULTS: Eleven main ingredients were detected in TML and the contents of homoorientin and berberine were quantified. Additionally, the results demonstrated that TML profoundly inhibited weight loss in mice and ameliorated lung pathological injury induced by PM. Furthermore, we also found that TML significantly decreased the lung wet to dry weight (W/D) ratios, reduced total protein in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and effectively attenuated PM-induced increased leukocyte and macrophages in BALF. Meanwhile, TML could pronouncedly inhibited myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in lung tissues, decreased the PM-induced inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-&#945; (TNF-&#945;), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-1ß (IL-1ß), reduced nitric oxide (NO) and increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) in BALF. In addition, TML markedly facilitated the expression of p-AMPK-Nrf2 and suppressed the expression of KEAP, prohibited the activation of the MAPKs-NLRP3/caspase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2), and inhibited apoptotic pathways. CONCLUSION: These findings indicated that TML attenuated PM-induced ALI through suppressing the release of inflammatory cytokines and alleviating oxidative damage correlated with the AMPK-Nrf2/KEAP signaling pathways, MAPKs-NLRP3/caspase-1 signaling pathways, as well as apoptotic pathways.",2020,"Badamjav, Rentsen; Zhang, Lu; Sonom, Dolgor; Wu, Yun-Hao; Kou, Jun-Ping; Yu, Bo-Yang; Li, Fang",J Ethnopharmacol,,#32916235,,,,,221635971.0

Even after a full year of research and study, the most effective way to control the spread of this infection is early diagnosis and isolation of the cases. Real-time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) is considered the standard test all over the world for the diagnosis of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. All the sample collection guidelines have recommended stringent maintenance of the cold chain for the sample transport. However, it is not possible for the resource constrained developing countries with inadequate infrastructure to comply with these guidelines all the time. Aim: To determine necessity of these stringent transport criteria and the effect of temperature on the clinical sensitivity of a RT-PCR assay for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Materials and Methods: In this prospective experimental study conducted in November 2020, 49 positive samples were kept at ambient room temperature and were tested everyday with RT-PCR for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 Ribonucleic Acid (RNA). The samples were also kept under refrigeration at the 4°C and were also tested by RT-PCR and the results were compared with their respective counterparts kept at room temperature till nine days. Python Jupiter notebook SciPy and Anaconda software was used for statistical analysis. Results: It was observed that the positivity of the RT-PCR results were not deteriorated till five days and there was no significant deterioration even after nine days of samples being stored at room temperature suggesting that even if the viral RNA itself is not stable outside strict temperature control but small fragment or target genetic sequences are enough for detection of virus by RT-PCR.

Transmission occurs primarily through direct physical head-to-head contact. In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic. COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2, a variant of the coronavirus. Therefore, on March 18, 2020, the Argentinean government established mandatory isolation for an indefinite period. This obligatory isolation interrupted regular classes avoiding direct contact between children, thus affecting the dispersal route of individuals and the evolution of head louse populations. In this study, we evaluated through an online survey how confinement affected the prevalence of lice during lockdown compared to the situation prior to confinement. The survey allowed to discriminate the different control strategies, the number of treatments, and the amount of insects recorded by parents. Data of 1118 children obtained from 627 surveys were analyzed. As the main result, it was observed that prevalence of lice decreased significantly from before (69.6%) to during (43.9%) COVID-19 lockdown. Moreover, head lice infestation was more effectively controlled in households with up to 2 children in comparison to households with 3 or more children.

numz4aqo,,WHO,The Acoustic Dissection of Cough: Diving into Machine Listening-based COVID-19 Analysis and Detection,,,,unk,"PurposeThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a crisis worldwide. Amounts of efforts have been made to prevent and control COVID-19s transmission, from early screenings to vaccinations and treatments. Recently, due to the spring up of many automatic disease recognition applications based on machine listening techniques, it would be fast and cheap to detect COVID-19 from recordings of cough, a key symptom of COVID-19. To date, knowledge on the acoustic characteristics of COVID-19 cough sounds is limited, but would be essential for structuring effective and robust machine learning models. The present study aims to explore acoustic features for distinguishing COVID-19 positive individuals from COVID-19 negative ones based on their cough sounds. MethodsWith the theory of computational paralinguistics, we analyse the acoustic correlates of COVID-19 cough sounds based on the COMPARE feature set, i. e., a standardised set of 6,373 acoustic higher-level features. Furthermore, we train automatic COVID-19 detection models with machine learning methods and explore the latent features by evaluating the contribution of all features to the COVID-19 status predictions. ResultsThe experimental results demonstrate that a set of acoustic parameters of cough sounds, e. g., statistical functionals of the root mean square energy and Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, are relevant for the differentiation between COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative cough samples. Our automatic COVID-19 detection model performs significantly above chance level, i. e., at an unweighted average recall (UAR) of 0.632, on a data set consisting of 1,411 cough samples (COVID-19 positive/negative: 210/1,201). ConclusionsBased on the acoustic correlates analysis on the COMPARE feature set and the feature analysis in the effective COVID-19 detection model, we find that the machine learning method to a certain extent relies on acoustic features showing higher effects in conventional group difference testing.",2022,"Ren, Zhao; Chang, Yi; Bartl-Pokorny, Katrin D.; Pokorny, Florian B.; Schuller, Bjoern W.",,,#ppmedrxiv-22271693,,,,,247359177.0

The unavailability of specific treatment against SARS-CoV-2 infection necessitates the focus of all scientists in this direction. The reported antiviral activities of guanidine alkaloids encouraged us to run a comprehensive in silico binding affinity of fifteen guanidine alkaloids against five different proteins of SARS-CoV-2, which we investigated. The investigated proteins are COVID-19 main protease (Mpro) (PDB ID: 6lu7), spike glycoprotein (PDB ID: 6VYB), nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (PDB ID: 6VYO), membrane glycoprotein (PDB ID: 6M17), and a non-structural protein (nsp10) (PDB ID: 6W4H). The binding energies for all tested compounds indicated promising binding affinities. A noticeable superiority for the pentacyclic alkaloids particularly, crambescidin 786 (5) and crambescidin 826 (13) has been observed. Compound 5 exhibited very good binding affinities against Mpro (&#916;G = -8.05 kcal/mol), nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (&#916;G = -6.49 kcal/mol), and nsp10 (&#916;G = -9.06 kcal/mol). Compound 13 showed promising binding affinities against Mpro (&#916;G = -7.99 kcal/mol), spike glycoproteins (&#916;G = -6.95 kcal/mol), and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (&#916;G = -8.01 kcal/mol). Such promising activities might be attributed to the long &#969;-fatty acid chain, which may play a vital role in binding within the active sites. The correlation of c Log P with free binding energies has been calculated. Furthermore, the SAR of the active compounds has been clarified. The Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity (ADMET) studies were carried out in silico for the 15 compounds; most examined compounds showed optimal to good range levels of ADMET aqueous solubility, intestinal absorption and being unable to pass blood brain barrier (BBB), non-inhibitors of CYP2D6, non-hepatotoxic, and bind plasma protein with a percentage less than 90%. The toxicity of the tested compounds was screened in silico against five models (FDA rodent carcinogenicity, carcinogenic potency TD50, rat maximum tolerated dose, rat oral LD50, and rat chronic lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL)). All compounds showed expected low toxicity against the tested models. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations were also carried out to confirm the stable binding interactions of the most promising compounds, 5 and 13, with their targets.

The number of cases changes quickly and varies depending upon which source you use to track, so in the current epidemiological context, the early recognition is critical for the rapid identification of suspected cases (with SARS-CoV-2 infection-like symptoms and signs) to be immediately subjected to quarantine measures. Although surveys are widely used for identifying COVID-19 cases, outcomes and associated risks, no validated epidemiological tool exists for surveying SARS-CoV-2 infection in the population so far. Methods Our study is the phase II of the EPICOVID19 national survey, launched in April 2020 including a national convenience sample of 201121 adults, who voluntarily filled the EPICOVID19 questionnaire. The phase II questionnaire was mailed to all subjects who underwent tests for COVID-19 by nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and who accepted to be involved in the second phase of the study, focused on the results reported for NPS and/or serological IgG/IgM tests. We evaluated the capability of the self-reported symptoms collected through the EPICOVID19 questionnaire to discriminate the COVID-19 among symptomatic subjects, in order to identify possible cases to undergo instrumental measurements and clinical examinations. We defined a method for the identification of a total score and validated it with reference to the serological and molecular clinical diagnosis, using four standard steps: identification of critical factors, confirmation of presence of latent variable, development of optimal scoring algorithm and validation of the scoring algorithm. Findings 2703 subjects [66% response rate] completed the Phase II questionnaire. Of 2703 individuals, 694 (25.7%) were NPS(+) and of these 84 (12.1% of the 694 NPS(+)) were asymptomatic. In the individuals who performed serological testing, of the 472 who did IgG(+) and 421 who did IgM(+), 22.9% and 11.6% tested positive, respectively. Among IgG(+) 1 of 108 subjects was asymptomatic (0.9%) while 5/49 subjects among IgM(+) were asymptomatic (10.2%). Compared with NPS(-), among NPS(+) subjects there was a higher rate for Fever (421 [60.7%] vs 391[19.5% ]; p<0.0001), Loss of Taste and/or Smell (365 [52.6%] vs 239 [11.9% ]; p<0.0001) and Cough (352 [50.7%] vs 580 [28.9% ]; p<0.0001). Also for other symptoms the frequencies were significantly higher in NPS(+) subjects than in NPS(-) ones (p<0.001). Among groups with serological tests, the symptoms with higher percentages in the subjects IgG(+) were Fever (65 [60.2%] vs 43[11.8% ]; p<0.0001) and Pain in muscles, bones, joints (73 [67.6%] vs 71 [19.5% ]; p<0.0001). For the COVID-19 self-reported symptoms items, exploratory (proportion variance explained [89.9%]) and confirmatory factor analysis results (SMSR 0.072; RMSEA 0.052) highlights the presence of one latent variable (factor) underlying the symptoms.

The spreading and infection factors of this disease are very high. A huge number of people from most of the countries are infected within four months from its first report of appearance and it keeps spreading. The required systems are not ready up to some stages for any pandemic; therefore, mitigation with existing capacity becomes necessary. On the other hand, modern-era largely depends on Artificial Intelligence(AI) including Data Science, and Deep Learning(DL) is one of the current flag-bearer of these techniques. It could use to mitigate COVID-19 like pandemics in terms of stop spread, diagnosis of the disease, drug & vaccine discovery, treatment, and many more. But this DL requires large datasets as well as powerful computing resources. A shortage of reliable datasets of a running pandemic is a common phenomenon. So, Deep Transfer Learning(DTL) would be effective as it learns from one task and could work on another task. In addition, Edge Devices(ED) such as IoT, Webcam, Drone, Intelligent Medical Equipment, Robot, etc. are very useful in a pandemic situation. These types of equipment make the infrastructures sophisticated and automated which helps to cope with an outbreak. But these are equipped with low computing resources, so, applying DL is also a bit challenging; therefore, DTL also would be effective there. This article scholarly studies the potentiality and challenges of these issues. It has described relevant technical backgrounds and reviews of the related recent state-of-the-art.

This paper describes my experience of flipping an online classroom for a core Chemical Engineering Fluid Mechanics class to promote student engagement and collaboration in an online setting. Comparing exam scores with prior semesters involving in-person, traditional lecture-style classes suggests students need a certain degree of adjustment to adapt to this new learning mode. A decrease in Student Rating of Teaching (SRT) scores indicates that students largely prefer in-person, traditional lectures over an online flipped class, even though written comments in the SRT contained several responses favorable to flipping the class in an online setting. Overall, SRT scores on a department level also showed a similar decrease, which suggests students were less satisfied with the quality of teaching overall throughout the department, with this flipped method of instruction neither improving nor worsening student sentiment towards online learning. In addition, whereas most students liked the pre-recorded lecture videos, they were less enthusiastic about using breakout rooms to encourage student collaboration and discussion. Further thought and discussion on best practices to facilitate online student interaction and collaboration are recommended, as online learning will likely continue to grow in popularity even when in-person instruction resumes after the pandemic.",2021-08-12,"Lai, Victor K",Journal of biomechanical engineering,,,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34382645/; https://doi.org/10.1115/1.4052109,236989073.0

STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a prospective cohort study among 50 Finnish military recruits with clinically diagnosed ARS in spring 2012. METHODS: We collected symptom, nasal endoscopy, and cone‐beam CT (CBCT) scores during the early (2–3 days from onset) and later phases (9–10 days). We took viral samples from the nasopharynx (multiplex respiratory virus polymerase chain reaction [PCR]), bacterial culture from the middle meatus during both phases, and both viral and bacterial samples from the maxillary sinus aspirate (respiratory virus PCR, bacterial culture, broad‐range bacterial PCR) during the later phase. Cilia destruction and microbial biofilms were sought from a nasal mucosal biopsy sample. RESULTS: We found that 42 (84%) of the subjects had viral nucleic acid in the nasopharynx during ARS. During the early phase, 28 (56%) of the subjects had nontypeable H. influenzae (NTHi) in the middle meatus, which was associated with wider paranasal mucosal changes in CBCT scans and increased symptoms during the study period. After 9 to 10 days from the onset, NTHi was found in the maxillary sinus in eight subjects (40%, 8/20) and led to prolonged symptoms. Bacterial biofilm was ruled out in 39 (78%) cases, and cilia destruction did not correlate with microbiological or clinical outcomes. CONCLUSION: Nasal and paranasal H. influenzae coinfection during viral infection may modify the symptoms and the extent of sinonasal mucosal disease observed in CBCT scans already from the beginning of the ARS episode.

METHODS: During the study period, 237 S. pneumoniae isolates were collected from non-duplicate patients, covering 15.0% of IPD cases in Taiwan. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using a Sensititre® system. A latex agglutination method (ImmuLex™ Pneumotest Kit) was used to determine serotypes. RESULTS: Susceptibility rates were high for vancomycin (100%), teicoplanin (100%) and linezolid (100%), followed by ceftaroline (non-meningitis) (98.3%), moxifloxacin (94.9%) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (89.9%). MIC(50) and MIC(90) values of dalbavancin, telavancin, tedizolid, eravacycline and omadacycline were generally low. Non-vaccine serotype 23A was the leading cause of IPD across the adult age range. Isolates of serotype 15B were slightly fewer than those of PCV-13 serotypes in patients aged ≥65 years. The overall case fatality rate was 15.2% (36/237) but was especially high for non-PCV-13 serotype 15B (21.4%; 3/14).

Asthma, lung cancer, bronchiectasis, pulmonary fibrosis acute respiratory distress syndrome, and COPD all include inflammation as a significant component. Microbe invasions, as well as the damage and even death of host cells, can cause and sustain inflammation. To counteract the negative consequences of irritants, the airways are equipped with cellular and host defense immunological systems that block the cellular entrance of these irritants or eliminate them from airway regions by triggering the immune system. Failure to activate the host defense system will trigger chronic inflammatory cataracts, leading to permanent lung damage. This damage makes the lungs more susceptible to various respiratory diseases. There are certain restrictions of the available therapy for lung illnesses. Vitamins are nutritional molecules that are required for optimal health but are not produced by the human body. Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D) is classified as a vitamin, although it is a hormone. Vitamin D is thought to perform a function in bone and calcium homeostasis.

DESIGN: Online survey with open‐ended questions to collect qualitative data. METHODS: In August 2020, we asked UK‐based nursing staff to describe any strategies they employed to overcome barriers to delivering care in 15 fundamental nursing care categories when providing care to non‐invasively ventilated patients with COVID‐19. We analysed data using Framework Analysis. RESULTS: A total of 1062 nurses consented to participate in our survey. We derived four themes. 1) Communication behaviours included adapting verbal and non‐verbal communication with patients, using information technology to enable patients’ significant others to communicate with staff and patients, and establishing clear information‐sharing methods with other staff. 2) Organizing care required clustering interventions, carefully managing supplies, encouraging patient self‐care and using ‘runners’ and interdisciplinary input. 3) Addressing patients’ well‐being and values required spending time with patients, acting in loco familiae, providing access to psychological and spiritual support, obtaining information about patients’ wishes early on and providing privacy and comforting/meaningful items. 4) Management and leadership behaviours included training, timely provision of pandemic information, psychological support, team huddles and facilitating regular breaks. CONCLUSIONS: Our respondents identified multiple strategies in four main areas of clinical practice. Management and leadership are crucial to both fundamental care delivery and the well‐being of nurses during pandemics. Grouping strategies into these areas of action may assist nurses and leaders to prepare for pandemic nursing.

However, the titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies varied in each individual, and the precise factors that might govern such variation have not been elucidated. Objectives: To assess the factors associated with high titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody among COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) donors. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Saiful Anwar General Hospital, Malang, Indonesia. Information of interest including demographic characteristics, clinical symptoms, comorbidities, laboratory findings, and the titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody among COVID-19 CCP donors were collected. The correlation was assessed using multiple logistic regression. Results: A total of 50 COVID-19 CCP donors with the titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody of more than 1:320 and 33 donors with the titers of less than 1:320 were analyzed. Our analysis revealed that CCP donors with history of cough, fever, dyspnea, and pneumonia significantly had higher titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody compared to asymptomatic donors. Moreover, CCP donors with elevated levels of eosinophils and immature granulocytes and low levels of albumins had higher levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody. The titer of antibody was not affected by comorbidities of donors. Conclusions: CPP donors who had experience of symptomatic COVID-19 with high eosinophils level, high immature granulocytes and low albumin level have higher titers of anti-SARS-COV-2 antibody than those who experienced asymptomatic COVID-19.

Ag-specific mucosal immunoglobulin (Ig) A and systemic IgG, together with virus-neutralizing activities, were highly induced in mice immunized with Co4B-conjugated S-RBD (S-RBD-Co4B) compared to those immunized with unconjugated S-RBD. Ag-specific T cell-mediated immunity was also induced in the spleen and lungs of mice intranasally immunized with S-RBD-Co4B. Intranasal immunization of hDPP4-Tg mice with S-RBD-Co4B reduced immune cell infiltration into the tissues of virus-challenged mice. Finally, S-RBD-Co4B-immunized mice exhibited were better protected against infection, more likely to survive, and exhibited less body weight loss. Collectively, our results suggest that S-RBD-Co4B could be used as an intranasal vaccine candidate against MERS-CoV infection.",2021-12-30,"Yang, Ye Lin; Kim, Ju; Jeong, Yongsu; Jang, Yong-Suk",Vaccine,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/f21b373ee47214a0a5daa89d820b92b8b161e71c.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8716170.xml.json,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X21016650; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.12.057; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34991928/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X21016650?v=s5,245539776.0

As a result, the Markov switching model is used to study the influence of policy uncertainty and the COVID-19 pandemic on commodity prices in the USA. Commodity markets are stimulated by economic policy uncertainty, according to results from a two-state Markov switching model. In both high and low regimes, economic policy uncertainty (EPU) influences the commodity market, according to the study’s findings. However, in the high regime, EPU has a greater influence on the energy and metal sectors. EPU has different influences on commodity markets in high- and low-volatility regimes, according to this study. There is a wide range of correlations between COVID-19 outcomes and EPU and how the prices of natural gas, oil, corn, silver, soybean, copper, gold, and steel respond to these tremors, in both high- and low-volatility tenure.

Drawing on the knowledge-based theory of the firm, we hypothesize that the choice between distant and local collaboration systematically relates to the knowledge capabilities of the firms’ R&D units, the characteristics of the focal knowledge, and local knowledge leakage risks. Analysis of close to 13,000 research collaborations with foreign universities by the world’s major biopharmaceutical firms (1995–2015) confirms that collaboration at distance occurs if this allows the firm to benefit from scale and knowledge diversity advantages, if the central unit has strong basic research capabilities, and if collaboration is in a core research domain of the MNC while rival firms are locally present. Maturity of the focal research domain is associated with local collaboration. Our findings qualify the common arguments in favor of collaboration in proximity and suggest that (distant) central R&D units are important orchestrators of research collaboration with universities around the globe.

There is a lack of granular data on RSV‐associated hospitalization per season using laboratory confirmed results. Our current study addresses this issue and intends to fill this gap. METHODS: The study was conducted from 2014 through 2018, in 4 to 10 hospitals in the Valencia Region, Spain. Infants included in this study were admitted in hospital through the Emergency Department with a respiratory complaint and tested by RT‐PCR for RSV in a central laboratory. RESULTS: Incidence rates of RSV‐associated hospitalization varied by season and hospital. Overall, the highest incidence rates were observed in 2017/2018. RSV‐associated hospitalization was highest in infants below 3 months of age and in those born before or at the beginning of the RSV season. Almost 54% of total infants hospitalized with laboratory confirmed RSV were found to be born outside the season, from April to October. The RSV positivity rate by ICD‐10 discharged codes varied by season and age with results from 48% to 57% among LRI (J09‐J22). CONCLUSION: The study was instrumental in bringing forth the time unpredictability of RSV epidemics, the critical impact of age, and the comparable distribution of RSV‐associated hospitalization in infants born on either side of the RSV season.

This study investigated whether Quer improves dysregulated lipid metabolism and suppresses hepatic steatosis in ovariectomized (OVX) mice as an experimental model mimicking postmenopausal women. Mice were assigned to the following four groups: SHAM, OVX, OVX + β-estradiol (0.4 mg/kg diet), and OVX + Quer (500 mg/kg diet). Mice were administered a diet with or without Quer for three months. OVX mice displayed significantly higher body mass, epidermal fat, and liver weights than those of SHAM mice. However, these levels were reduced in Quer-treated mice. Quer treatment reduced the levels of serum lipid metabolites, including triglycerides, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Furthermore, Quer reduced liver lipid steatosis and inhibited the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-6, and IL-1β.

In the United States these orders were not coordinated at the national level during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which creates an opportunity to use spatial and temporal variation to measure the policies' effect with greater accuracy. Here, we combine data on the timing of stay-at-home orders with daily confirmed COVID-19 cases and fatalities at the county level in the United States. We estimate the effect of stay-at-home orders using a difference-in-differences design that accounts for unmeasured local variation in factors like health systems and demographics and for unmeasured temporal variation in factors like national mitigation actions and access to tests. Compared to counties that did not implement stay-at-home orders, the results show that the orders are associated with a 30.2 percent (11.0 to 45.2) reduction in weekly cases after one week, a 40.0 percent (23.4 to 53.0) reduction after two weeks, and a 48.6 percent (31.1 to 61.7) reduction after three weeks. Stay-at-home orders are also associated with a 59.8 percent (18.3 to 80.2) reduction in weekly fatalities after three weeks.

METHODS: Electronic (via PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature database, Brazilian Library in Dentistry, and Cochrane Library) and gray literature searches were performed for documents published up to May 12, 2020. Guidelines updated until April 17, 2021 were identified. Documents were included as guidelines if they (1) consisted of a set of statements, directions, or principles presenting current or future rules or policy; (2) were developed by government agencies, institutions, organizations, or expert panels; and (3) were related to the general conduct of healthcare activities rather a particular condition. Two researchers, using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research & Evaluation II, independently extracted the recommendations and evaluated the quality of the guidelines. RESULTS: Twenty-seven documents from 19 countries were included in the review. These documents presented 122 recommendations related to (1) professional biosafety; (2) patients’/companions’ safety; (3) the organization and biosafety of the physical dental facility environment; and (4) the work process in dental care. Overall, the scientific quality of the guidelines was considered low. Some recommendations presented in these guidelines would require further research to establish their effectiveness.

Yet, partitioning of total forest C stocks, particularly between aboveground woody biomass and the soil, greatly impacts the stability of C stocks against disturbances in forest ecosystems. This study assessed the impact of species composition and stand density on C storage in aboveground woody biomass (stem + branches), coarse roots, and soil, and their partitioning in pure and mixed forests in Europe. We used 21 triplets (5 beech-oak, 8 pine-beech, 8 pine-oak mixed stands, and their respective monocultures at the same sites) in seven European countries. We computed biomass C stocks from total stand inventories and species-specific allometric equations, and soil organic C data down to 40 cm depth. On average, the broadleaved species stored more C in aboveground woody biomass than soil, while C storage in pine was equally distributed between both components. Stand density had a strong effect on C storage in tree woody biomass but not in the soil. After controlling for stand basal area, the mixed stands had, on average, similar total C stocks (in aboveground woody biomass + coarse roots + soil) to the most performing monocultures. Although species composition and stand density affect total C stocks and its partitioning between aboveground woody biomass and soil, a large part of variability in soil C storage was unrelated to stand characteristics.

Results showed the H1N1 2009 VLP vaccine was safe and well-tolerated. Systemic solicited events were similar between placebo and VLP vaccinated groups with no vaccine-related serious adverse events. Dose response trends for solicited local adverse events were observed, with higher incidences of local pain, swelling, tenderness, and redness reported in the higher VLP dose groups (15 μg and 45 μg) compared to the placebo and 5 μg VLP groups following both vaccinations. Although the majority of local AEs were mild in severity, a dose trend in events of moderate or greater severity was also noted for these solicited events. The VLP vaccine groups demonstrated robust HAI immune responses after a single vaccination, with high rates of seroprotection (≥40 HAI titer) in 82–92% of all subjects and in 64–85% of subjects who were seronegative at the time of immunization.

Disability law, properly understood, permits considering medical evidence about patients’ probability of surviving treatment and the quantity of scarce treatments they will likely use. It also permits prioritizing health workers, and considering patients’ post-treatment life expectancy. These factors, when based on medical evidence and not inaccurate stereotypes, are legal to consider even if they disadvantage some patients with specific disabilities. <br><br>It then discusses the ethical advantages of triage policies that use medical evidence to save more lives and years of life, which I call “evidence-based triage,” focusing on the benefits of these policies for patients with disabilities. In doing so, I explain why recent critiques err by treating people with disabilities as a monolith, overlooking the political disadvantages of less-visible victims, and treating the social origins of scarcity as a justification for saving fewer lives. Evidence-based triage parallels other policy responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, like physical distancing and postponement of medical procedures, which may burden patients with specific disabilities or medical conditions but are nevertheless justified because they save more patients.",2020,"Persad, Govind",,,#ppcovidwho-293942,,,,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3571139,216250406.0

ELIGIBLE DATA: Cross-sectional survey of countries and US states with at least 800 COVID-19 deaths as of April 24, 2020 and with information on the number of deaths in people with age <65. Data were available for 14 countries (Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, UK) and 13 US states (California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania). We also examined available data on COVID-19 deaths in people with age <65 and no underlying diseases. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportion of COVID-19 deaths in people <65 years old; relative mortality rate of COVID-19 death in people <65 versus &#8805;65 years old; absolute risk of COVID-19 death in people <65 and in those &#8805;80 years old in the general population as of June 17, 2020; absolute COVID-19 mortality rate expressed as equivalent of mortality rate from driving a motor vehicle. RESULTS: Individuals with age <65 account for 4.5-11.2% of all COVID-19 deaths in European countries and Canada, 8.3-22.7% in the US locations, and were the majority in India and Mexico. People <65 years old had 30- to 100-fold lower risk of COVID-19 death than those &#8805;65 years old in 11 European countries and Canada, 16- to 52-fold lower risk in US locations, and less than 10-fold in India and Mexico. The absolute risk of COVID-19 death as of June 17, 2020 for people <65 years old in high-income countries ranged from 10 (Germany) to 349 per million (New Jersey) and it was 5 per million in India and 96 per million in Mexico. The absolute risk of COVID-19 death for people &#8805;80 years old ranged from 0.6 (Florida) to 17.5 per thousand (Connecticut). The COVID-19 mortality rate in people <65 years old during the period of fatalities from the epidemic was equivalent to the mortality rate from driving between 4 and 82 miles per day for 13 countries and 5 states, and was higher (equivalent to the mortality rate from driving 106-483 miles per day) for 8 other states and the UK. People <65 years old without underlying predisposing conditions accounted for only 0.7-3.6% of all COVID-19 deaths in France, Italy, Netherlands, Sweden, Georgia, and New York City and 17.7% in Mexico.

Along with small size vanadium complexes a vanadium-containing derivative of the peptide-like inhibitor N3 (N-[(5-methylisoxazol-3-yl)carbonyl]alanyl-l-valyl-N1-((1R,2Z)-4-(benzyloxy)-4-oxo-1-{[(3R)-2-oxopyrrolidin-3-yl] methyl }but-2-enyl)-l-leucinamide) was designed from the crystal structure with PDB entry code 6LU7. On theoretical grounds our consensus docking studies evaluated the binding affinities at the hitherto known binding site of Mpro for binding vanadium complexes. The site is an evolutionarily fold unit which is structurally conserved among proteins belonging to the same enzyme class (EC 3). The highly conserved sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 protease Mpro has a Cys-His dyad at the catalytic site that are characteristic of metal-dependent or metal-inhibited hydrolases. Therefore, Mpro was superimposed to the human protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (hPTP1B) which is a key regulator at an early stage in the signalling cascade of the insulin hormone for glucose uptake into cells. Comparatively, the vanadium-ligand binding site of hPTP1B is located in a larger groove on the surface of Mpro. Vanadium constitutes a well-known phosphate analogue. Hence, its study offers possibilities to design promising vanadium-containing binders to SARS-CoV-2.

A wide array of causal links connecting CVD and COVID-19 baffle the overall prognosis as well as the efficacy of the given therapeutic interventions. At the centre of this puzzle lies ACE2 that works as a receptor for the SARS-CoV-2, and functional expression of which is also needed to minimize vasoconstriction otherwise would lead to high blood pressure. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 infection seems to reduce the functional expression of ACE2. Given these circumstances, it might be advisable to consider a treatment plan for COVID-19 patients with CVD in an approach that would neither aggravate the vasodeleterious arm of the renin-angiotensinogen-aldosterone system (RAAS) nor compromise the vasoprotective arm of RAAS but is effective to minimize or if possible, inhibit the viral replication. Given the immune modulatory role of Zn in both CVD and COVID-19 pathogenesis, zinc supplement to the selective treatment plan for CVD and COVID-19 comorbid conditions, to be decided by the clinicians depending on the cardiovascular conditions of the patients, might greatly improve the therapeutic outcome.

This has led to the development of several vaccines against COVID-19 within one year. This study aimed to assess the attitudes and the side effects among Arab communities after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine and use of machine learning (ML) tools to predict post-vaccination side effects based on predisposing factors. Methods: An online-based multinational survey was carried out via social media platforms from 14 June to 31 August 2021, targeting individuals who received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine from 22 Arab countries. Descriptive statistics, correlation, and chi-square tests were used to analyze the data. Moreover, extensive ML tools were utilized to predict 30 post vaccination adverse effects and their severity based on 15 predisposing factors. The importance of distinct predisposing factors in predicting particular side effects was determined using global feature importance employing gradient boost as AutoML. Results: A total of 10,064 participants from 19 Arab countries were included in this study. Around 56% were female and 59% were aged from 20 to 39 years old. A high rate of vaccine hesitancy (51%) was reported among participants. Almost 88% of the participants were vaccinated with one of three COVID-19 vaccines, including Pfizer-BioNTech (52.8%), AstraZeneca (20.7%), and Sinopharm (14.2%). About 72% of participants experienced post-vaccination side effects. This study reports statistically significant associations (p < 0.01) between various predisposing factors and post-vaccinations side effects. In terms of predicting post-vaccination side effects, gradient boost, random forest, and XGBoost outperformed other ML methods. The most important predisposing factors for predicting certain side effects (i.e., tiredness, fever, headache, injection site pain and swelling, myalgia, and sleepiness and laziness) were revealed to be the number of doses, gender, type of vaccine, age, and hesitancy to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Conclusions: The reported side effects following COVID-19 vaccination among Arab populations are usually non-life-threatening; flu-like symptoms and injection site pain. Certain predisposing factors have greater weight and importance as input data in predicting post-vaccination side effects. Based on the most significant input data, ML can also be used to predict these side effects; people with certain predicted side effects may require additional medical attention, or possibly hospitalization.",2022-02-26,"Hatmal, Ma’mon M.; Al-Hatamleh, Mohammad A.

The lack of vaccines and antivirals prevents clinical strategies against the disease, creating an emerging need for the development of safe and effective treatments. Strategies for vaccine development include complete vaccines against viruses, subunits, and nucleic acids, but are still in their early stages.

Although real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the current recommended laboratory method, several rapid antigen point-of-care tests (POCTs) were developed as frontline testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess a recently CE-approved POCT, SARS-CoV-2 Ag Test on the LumiraDx™ Platform (LumiraDx GmbH, Cologne, Germany) for the identification of SARS-COV-2 infected subjects at hospital setting. METHODS: LumiraDx POCT was implemented in three hospital settings: adult and pediatric emergency departments and occupational medicine department along two-month period during the second peak of Italian SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Rapid antigen testing was performed on direct nasal swabs and results were compared with those obtained by Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay. RESULTS: Overall sensitivity, specificity, NPV and PPV were 90.3%, 92.1%, 95.1%, and 84.9%, respectively, compared to reference method. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV for symptomatic group were 89.3% [95% IC 84.2-93.3], 88.2% [95% IC 72.5-96.7], 97.8% [95% IC 94.6-99.1], and 58.8% [95% IC 48.4-68.5], respectively.

For them the coronavirus is an enemy that should be defeated as a part of one’s job. They do, however, also have a daily life with family while doing their work obligations. The purpose of this study was to gain an in-depth understanding of the frontline healthcare professionals’ experience of balancing work life and family life during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A sample of 22 frontline healthcare professionals caring for patients with COVID-19 was included and interviewed individually from May to August 2020. Ricoeur’s phenomenological hermeneutical philosophy inspired the methodology in this study. RESULT: Frontline healthcare professionals treating and caring for patients with COVID-19 are, voluntarily or involuntarily, forced to be ready to change departments as well as being ready to face the unknown coronavirus. The frontline work leads to feelings of being abandoned among their families and friends due to the threat of bringing the infection home and spreading the virus. Although healthcare professionals are facing a working life filled with uncertainty and unpredictability impacting their family life, they express opposing feelings of being a part of something bigger. CONCLUSIONS: The work life balance for these healthcare professionals is threatened by changes in professional responsibilities, working hours and shifts. Fear of bringing the infection home challenges them ethically and creates a distance between healthcare professionals and their families, leading to a conflict within the individual if their work on the frontline is worth it - or if it is a too high price to pay.

A novel SARS-associated coronavirus was identified as its principal etiologic agent; however, the immunopathogenesis of SARS and the role of special CTLs in virus clearance are still largely uncharacterized. In this study, potential HLA-A*0201-restricted spike (S) and nucleocapsid protein-derived peptides were selected from an online database and screened for potential CTL epitopes by in vitro refolding and T2 cell-stabilization assays. The antigenicity of nine peptides which could refold with HLA-A*0201 molecules was assessed with an IFN-gamma ELISPOT assay to determine the capacity to stimulate CTLs from PBMCs of HLA-A2(+) SARS-recovered donors. A novel HLA-A*0201-restricted decameric epitope P15 (S411-420, KLPDDFMGCV) derived from the S protein was identified and found to localize within the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor-binding region of the S1 domain. P15 could significantly enhance the expression of HLA-A*0201 molecules on the T2 cell surface, stimulate IFN-gamma-producing CTLs from the PBMCs of former SARS patients, and induce specific CTLs from P15-immunized HLA-A2.1 transgenic mice in vivo. Furthermore, significant P15-specific CTLs were induced from HLA-A2.1-transgenic mice immunized by a DNA vaccine encoding the S protein; suggesting that P15 was a naturally processed epitope.

Natural compounds may be useful to protecting health in this perilous condition. Mechanism of shuttle entry of SARS-COV-2 virus is by interaction with viral spike protein with human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor. To explore potential natural therapeutics, 213 important phytochemicals of nine medicinal plants Aconitum heterophyllum, Cassia angustifolia, Cymbopogon fl exuosus, Cymbopogon martinii, Nux vomica, Phyllanthus urinaria, Swertia chirayita, Justicia adhatoda, Vetiveria zizanioides were selected for in-silico molecular docking against the spike protein of SARS-COV-2 and compared with recently prescribed drug chloroquine, ramdesivir, lopinavir and hydroxychloroquine. Results revealed that rhamnocitrin of P. urinaria, 1,5-dihydroxy-3,8-dimethoxyxanthone of S. chirayita and laevojunenol of V. zizanioides potentially binds with the receptor binding site of SARS-COV-2 spike glycoprotein and more robustly destabilized the RBD-ACE-2 binding over chloroquine, ramdesivir, lopinavir and hydroxychloroquine. It was also found that laevojunenol, rhamnocitrin, and 1,5-dihydroxy-3,8-dimethoxyxanthone qualifi ed the criteria for drug-likeness as per Lipinski rule. After attachment of the selected phytochemical with the spike protein the affi nity of the later towards ACE-2 was minimized and the eff ect of 1,5-dihydroxy-3,8- dimethoxyxanthone and laevojunenol was superior. Hence, rhamnocitrin of P. urinaria, 1,5-dihydroxy-3,8-dimethoxyxanthone of S. chirayita and laevojunenol of V. zizanioides, are potential therapeutic molecules for SARS-COV-2, which upon binding with spike protein changes the affi nity of the spike towards ACE-2 and therefore restrict the entry of the virus into a human cell.

The detection of elevated blood pressure during pregnancy is one of the cardinal aspects of optimal antenatal care. With the outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the risk for person-to-person spread of the virus, there is a desire to minimize unnecessary visits to health care facilities. Women should be classified as low risk or high risk for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and adjustments can be accordingly made in the frequency of maternal and fetal surveillance. During this pandemic, all pregnant women should be encouraged to obtain a sphygmomanometer. Patients monitored for hypertension as an outpatient should receive written instructions on the important signs and symptoms of disease progression and provided contact information to report the development of any concern for change in status. As the clinical management of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia is the same, assessment of urinary protein is unnecessary in the management once a diagnosis of a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy is made. Pregnant women with suspected hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and signs and symptoms associated with the severe end of the disease spectrum (e.g., headaches, visual symptoms, epigastric pain, and pulmonary edema) should have an evaluation including complete blood count, serum creatinine level, and liver transaminases (aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase). Further, if there is any evidence of disease progression or if acute severe hypertension develops, prompt hospitalization is suggested. Current guidelines from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and The Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM) for management of preeclampsia with severe features suggest delivery after 34 (0/7) weeks of gestation. With the outbreak of COVID-19, however, adjustments to this algorithm should be considered including delivery by 30 (0/7) weeks of gestation in the setting of preeclampsia with severe features.

y9sr7ogk,,WHO,Computational simulation to assess patient safety of uncompensated COVID-19 two-patient ventilator sharing using the Pulse Physiology Engine,,,,unk,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic is stretching medical resources internationally, sometimes creating ventilator shortages that complicate clinical and ethical situations. The possibility of needing to ventilate multiple patients with a single ventilator raises patient health and safety concerns in addition to clinical conditions needing treatment. Wherever ventilators are employed, additional tubing and splitting adaptors may be available. Adjustable flow-compensating resistance for differences in lung compliance on individual limbs may not be readily implementable. By exploring a number and range of possible contributing factors using computational simulation without risk of patient harm, this paper attempts to define useful bounds for ventilation parameters when compensatory resistance in limbs of a shared breathing circuit is not possible. This desperate approach to shared ventilation support would be a last resort when alternatives have been exhausted. METHODS: A whole-body computational physiology model (using lumped parameters) was used to simulate each patient being ventilated. The primary model of a single patient with a dedicated ventilator was augmented to model two patients sharing a single ventilator. In addition to lung mechanics or estimation of CO2 and pH expected for set ventilation parameters (considerations of lung physiology alone), full physiological simulation provides estimates of additional values for oxyhemoglobin saturation, arterial oxygen tension, and other patient parameters. A range of ventilator settings and patient characteristics were simulated for paired patients. FINDINGS: To be useful for clinicians, attention has been directed to clinically available parameters. These simulations show patient outcome during multi-patient ventilation is most closely correlated to lung compliance, oxygenation index, oxygen saturation index, and end-tidal carbon dioxide of individual patients. The simulated patient outcome metrics were satisfactory when the lung compliance difference between two patients was less than 12 mL/cmH2O, and the oxygen saturation index difference was less than 2 mmHg. INTERPRETATION: In resource-limited regions of the world, the COVID-19 pandemic will result in equipment shortages. While single-patient ventilation is preferable, if that option is unavailable and ventilator sharing using limbs without flow resistance compensation is the only available alternative, these simulations provide a conceptual framework and guidelines for clinical patient selection.",2020,"Webb, Jeffrey B; Bray, Aaron; Asare, Philip K; Clipp, Rachel B; Mehta, Yatin B; Penupolu, Sudheer; Patel, Aalpen A; Poler, S Mark",PLoS One,,#945351,,,,,218887880.0

Individuals, organizations, and governments are using social media to communicate with each other on a number of issues relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. Not much is known about the topics being shared on social media platforms relating to COVID-19. Analyzing such information can help policy makers and health care organizations assess the needs of their stakeholders and address them appropriately. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify the main topics posted by Twitter users related to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Leveraging a set of tools (Twitter’s search application programming interface (API), Tweepy Python library, and PostgreSQL database) and using a set of predefined search terms (“corona,” “2019-nCov,” and “COVID-19”), we extracted the text and metadata (number of likes and retweets, and user profile information including the number of followers) of public English language tweets from February 2, 2020, to March 15, 2020. We analyzed the collected tweets using word frequencies of single (unigrams) and double words (bigrams). We leveraged latent Dirichlet allocation for topic modeling to identify topics discussed in the tweets. We also performed sentiment analysis and extracted the mean number of retweets, likes, and followers for each topic and calculated the interaction rate per topic. RESULTS: Out of approximately 2.8 million tweets included, 167,073 unique tweets from 160,829 unique users met the inclusion criteria. Our analysis identified 12 topics, which were grouped into four main themes: origin of the virus; its sources; its impact on people, countries, and the economy; and ways of mitigating the risk of infection. The mean sentiment was positive for 10 topics and negative for 2 topics (deaths caused by COVID-19 and increased racism). The mean for tweet topics of account followers ranged from 2722 (increased racism) to 13,413 (economic losses). The highest mean of likes for the tweets was 15.4 (economic loss), while the lowest was 3.94 (travel bans and warnings). CONCLUSIONS: Public health crisis response activities on the ground and online are becoming increasingly simultaneous and intertwined. Social media provides an opportunity to directly communicate health information to the public. Health systems should work on building national and international disease detection and surveillance systems through monitoring social media.

Its ability to develop resistance to the current antifungal drugs as well as its multiple virulence factors have rendered the problem even more complicated. Thus, in the present investigation, we elucidated an in vitro and in vivo antifungal activity of Encephalartos laurentianus methanol extract (ELME) against C. albicans clinical isolates for the first time. A phytochemical identification of 64 compounds was conducted in ELME using LC-MS/MS. Interestingly, ELME exhibited antifungal activity with MIC values that ranged from 32–256 µg/mL. Furthermore, we investigated the antibiofilm activity of ELME against the biofilms formed by C. albicans isolates. ELME displayed antibiofilm activity using a crystal violet assay as it decreased the percentages of cells, moderately and strongly forming biofilms from 62.5% to 25%. Moreover, the antibiofilm impact of ELME was elucidated using SEM and fluorescent microscope. A significant reduction in the biofilm formation by C. albicans isolates was observed. In addition, we observed that ELME resulted in the downregulation of the biofilm-related tested genes (ALS1, BCR1, PLB2, and SAP5) in 37.5% of the isolates using qRT-PCR. Besides, the in vivo antifungal activity of ELME on the kidney tissues of rats infected with C. albicans was investigated using histological and immunohistochemical studies. ELME was found to protect against C. albicans induced renal damage, decrease desmin and inducible nitric oxide synthase, increase alkaline phosphatase, and increase infected rats’ survival rate. Additionally, the cytotoxicity of ELME was elucidated on Human Skin Fibroblast normal cells using MTT assay. ELME had an IC(50) of 31.26 µg/mL.

A large-scale assessment of local, riparian and catchment-scale influences on Amazonian fish.",10.1111/1365-2664.13028,,32831394.0,unk,"Agricultural expansion and intensification are major threats to tropical biodiversity. In addition to the direct removal of native vegetation, agricultural expansion often elicits other human-induced disturbances, many of which are poorly addressed by existing environmental legislation and conservation programmes. This is particularly true for tropical freshwater systems, where there is considerable uncertainty about whether a legislative focus on protecting riparian vegetation is sufficient to conserve stream fauna.To assess the extent to which stream fish are being effectively conserved in agricultural landscapes, we examined the spatial distribution of assemblages in river basins to identify the relative importance of human impacts at instream, riparian and catchment scales, in shaping observed patterns. We used an extensive dataset on the ecological condition of 83 low-order streams distributed in three river basins in the eastern Brazilian Amazon.We collected and identified 24,420 individual fish from 134 species. Multiplicative diversity partitioning revealed high levels of compositional dissimilarity (DS) among stream sites (DS = 0.74 to 0.83) and river basins (DS = 0.82), due mainly to turnover (77.8% to 81.8%) rather than nestedness. The highly heterogeneous fish faunas in small Amazonian streams underscore the vital importance of enacting measures to protect forests on private lands outside of public protected areas.Instream habitat features explained more variability in fish assemblages (15%-19%) than riparian (2%-12%), catchment (4%-13%) or natural covariates (4%-11%). Although grouping species into functional guilds allowed us to explain up to 31% of their abundance (i.e. for nektonic herbivores), individual riparian - and catchment - scale predictor variables that are commonly a focus of environmental legislation explained very little of the observed variation (partial R2 values mostly <5%).Policy implications. Current rates of agricultural intensification and mechanization in tropical landscapes are unprecedented, yet the existing legislative frameworks focusing on protecting riparian vegetation seem insufficient to conserve stream environments and their fish assemblages. To safeguard the species-rich freshwater biota of small Amazonian streams, conservation actions must shift towards managing whole basins and drainage networks, as well as agricultural practices in already-cleared land.",2018-05-01,"Leal, Cecília G; Barlow, Jos; Gardner, Toby A; Hughes, Robert M; Leitão, Rafael P; Nally, Ralph Mac; Kaufmann, Philip R; Ferraz, Silvio F B; Zuanon, Jansen; de Paula, Felipe R; Ferreira, Joice; Thomson, James R; Lennox, Gareth D; Dary, Eurizângela P; Röpke, Cristhiana P; Pompeu, Paulo S",The Journal of applied ecology,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.13028; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32831394/,89692593.0

The extent of lung involvement and final outcome was compared across the two groups. Serial changes in imaging were also evaluated in 36 patients in the OP-group with a second CT scan. RESULTS: Duration from symptom onset to presentation was significantly higher in the OP group (7.07 ± 3.71 versus 6.13 ± 4.96 days, p = 0.008). A higher COVID-19-related mortality rate was observed among patients with OP-like pattern (17.5% vs 3.7%, p = 0.001).There was no significant difference in the overall involvement of the lungs (p = 0.358), but lower lobes were significantly more affected in the OP group (p < 0.001). Of the 36 patients with follow-up imaging (mean duration of follow-up = 8.3 ± 2.1 days), progression of infiltration was seen in more than 61% of patients while lesions had resolved in only 22.2% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our observation indicates that physicians should carefully monitor for the presence of OP-like pattern on initial CT as it is associated with a poor outcome. Furthermore, we recommend interval CT to evaluate the progression of infiltrations in these patients.",2021,"Raoufi, Masoomeh; Kahkooei, Shahram; Haseli, Sara; Robatjazi, Farzaneh; Bahri, Jamileh; Khalili, Nastaran",Adv. respir. med.

METHODS We analyzed electronic medical record data to compare intern clinical exposure during the COVID-19 pandemic from June 2020 through February 2021 with the same academic blocks from 2017 to 2020. We attributed patients to each pediatric intern on the basis of notes written during their pediatric hospital medicine rotation to compare intern exposures with common inpatient diagnoses before and during the pandemic. We compared the median number of notes written per intern per block overall, as well as for each common inpatient diagnosis. RESULTS Median counts of notes written per intern per block were significantly reduced in the COVID-19 group compared with the pre-COVID-19 group (96 [interquartile range (IQR): 81-119)] vs 129 [IQR: 110-160]; P < .001). Median intern notes per block was lower in the COVID-19 group for all months except February 2021. Although the median number of notes for many common inpatient diagnoses was significantly reduced, they were higher for mental health (4 [IQR: 2-9] vs 2 [IQR: 1-6]; P < .001) and suicidality (4.5 [IQR: 2-8] vs 0 [IQR: 0-2]; P < .001). Median shifts worked per intern per block was also reduced in the COVID-19 group (22 [IQR: 21-23] vs 23 [IQR: 22-24]; P < .001).

METHODS: Adult COVID-19 survivors discharged from hospitals between March 2020 and March 2021 were asked to complete a questionnaire at 4 weeks after discharge. The Chinese version of the 22-item Impact of Event Scale - Revised (IES-R) was used to measure symptoms of PTSD. The 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was used to assess symptoms of major depressive disorder. The 7-item Generalised Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) was used to measure symptoms of generalised anxiety disorder. The rates of anxiety, depression, and PTSD among discharged patients were determined, as were associations between psychosocial factors and outcome measures and predictors for moderate-tosevere symptoms of anxiety, depression, and PTSD. RESULTS: 96 men and 103 women aged 18 to 81 years returned the completed questionnaire. 12.1% to 20.1% of them reported symptoms of PTSD, anxiety, or depression. Higher symptom severity was associated with higher perceived life threat, lower emotional support, lower disease severity upon admission, and longer hospital stay. Women had more PTSD symptoms than men, particularly when knowing someone under quarantine.

It is usually sporadic, but outbreaks of infection may occasionally occur. In outbreaks, diagnosis and investigations were usually hampered by the non-specificity of laboratory testing methods to identify C. psittaci. In this study, we use metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) in the diagnosis of a family outbreak of psittacosis under COVID-19. Three members of an extended family of 6 persons developed psittacosis with pneumonia and hepatic involvement with common symptoms of fever and weakness. Two newly purchased pet parrots, which had died successively, were probably the primary source of infection. Imagings show lung consolidations and infiltrates, which are difficult to be differentiated from CAP caused by other common pathogens. mNGS rapidly identified the infecting agent as C. psittaci within 48 h. The results of this work suggest that there are not characteristic clinical manifestations and imagings of psittacosis pneumonia which can differentiate from CAP caused by other pathogens. The use of mNGS can improve accuracy and reduce the delay in the diagnosis of psittacosis especially during the outbreak, which can shorten the course of the disease control. Family outbreak under COVID-19 may be related to the familial aggregation due to the epidemic. To our knowledge, this is the first reported family outbreak of psittacosis in China, and the first reported psittacosis outbreak identified by the method of mNGS in the world.",2021-07-15,"Li, Na; Li, Shengjin; Tan, Wanmei; Wang, Hanghang; Xu, Huan; Wang, Daoxing",Emerging microbes & infections,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/ec18923205c3328bb03bc19739da59159e1c7955.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8284143.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1080/22221751.2021.1948358; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34176434/,235661765.0

Investigating the mechanical properties of glass is challenging because any global deformation that might result in shear rejuvenation would require a prohibitively long relaxation time. Moreover, glass is well known to be heterogeneous, and a global perturbation would prevent exploration of local mechanical/transport properties. However, investigation based on a local probe, i.e., microrheology, may overcome these problems. Here, we establish active microrheology of a bulk metallic glass, via a probe particle driven into host medium glass. This technique is amenable to experimental investigations via nanoindentation tests.

Serological testing for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies plays an important role in understanding and controlling the pandemics, notably through epidemiological surveillance. Well validated and highly specific SARS-CoV-2 serological assays are urgently needed. We describe here the analytical and clinical performance of VIDAS(R) SARS-CoV-2 IgM and VIDAS(R) SARS-CoV-2 IgG, two CE-marked, EUA-authorized, automated, qualitative assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG, respectively. Both assays showed high within-run and within-laboratory precision (coefficients of variation < 11.0%) and very low cross-reactivity towards sera of patients with a past common coronavirus or respiratory virus infection. Clinical specificity determined on up to 989 pre-pandemic healthy donors was [â¥] 99% with a narrow 95% confidence interval for both IgM and IgG assays. Clinical sensitivity was determined on up to 232 samples from 130 RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients.

Combined IgM/IgG test results improved the PPA compared to each test alone. SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroconversion followed closely that of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and remained stable over time, while SARS-CoV-2 IgM levels rapidly declined. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG responses were significantly higher in COVID-19 hospitalized vs. non-hospitalized patients.

OBJECTIVES: We determined how anxiety, depression, and pain outcomes varied during the “Stay-at-Home” order compared with the prepandemic period and whether nonspecific COVID-19 symptoms would occur. METHODS: We conducted an online survey to opportunistically reassess clinical anxiety, depression, pain intensity, and pain interference while controlling for somatic symptom severity during the prepandemic and Stay-at-Home order period. During the Stay-at-Home period, anxiety, depression, pain intensity, and pain interference were reassessed. Coping strategies were assessed as a critical factor influencing pain behaviors. In addition, we explored the occurrence of nonspecific COVID-19 symptoms with an ad hoc survey referencing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention publicly available COVID-19 symptoms. RESULTS: We observed a significant increase in depression and anxiety levels during the Stay-at-Home period. Coping strategy changes (eg, increased exercise) were linked to lower pain severity and interference which improved overall. Participants who self-reported nonspecific COVID-19 symptoms had higher prepandemic depression. Among the 72 participants not diagnosed with COVID-19, 70.8% of the participants experienced symptoms resembling those associated with COVID-19.

As such, several studies have screened FDA‐approved drugs in silico at a limited number of classical antiviral sites for anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 activity. We hypothesized that an extensive in‐silico drug repurposingscreen against a wide range of SARS‐COV‐2 proteins could identify novel antiviral drugs and help elucidate mechanisms of drug action of hits from in vitro screens. We selected 48 known or predicted drug sites across 23 SARS‐COV‐2 proteins using homology models and crystal structures based on known antiviral drug sites (i.e., polymerase or protease active sites), computational predictions, and protein‐protein interfaces. Then, using the software GOLD, we docked 1268 FDA‐approved small‐molecule drugs into each site. Virtual hits were prioritized based on their anti‐SARS‐COV‐2 activity found in a recent phenotypic drug‐repurposing screen using human huh‐7 epithelial cells. This resulted in the identification of a range of drugs acting at a variety of targets and sites. Several compelling drug/site pairs were identified, including sites on the Spike protein, which mediates viral entry. For example, we identified hits with anti‐SARS‐CoV2 activity in vitro, at a putative allosteric site that incorporates two functionalities required for viral entry, namely the Spike S2’ cleavage site – which a host protease must cleave for viral entry, and the critical ‘fusion peptide’ domain – which injects itself into the host membrane during viral entry. Moreover, these in silico results identify possible mechanisms for in vitro drug repurposing hits, potential additional targets for known drugs, and a starting point to test drug combinations that may have better activity by acting at different steps in the viral cycle activity in combination than on their own. 8.5.5",2021-05-14,"Olson, Keith; Chan, Wallace; Sexton, Jonathon; Carlson, Heather; Traynor, John",FASEB J,,,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8239541/,

Given the Condorcet Jury Theorem, individual virtue signallers need not be very reliable for the majority judgment to be very likely to be correct. Thus, even people who are skeptical of the judgments of individual virtue signallers should think that if a majority of them judge that a proposition is true, then that provides significant evidence that the proposition is true. We argue that this is mistaken. Various empirical studies converge on the following point: humans are very conformist in the contexts in which virtue signalling occurs. And stereotypical virtue signallers are even more conformist in such contexts. So we should be skeptical of the claim that virtue signallers are sufficiently independent for the Condorcet Jury Theorem to apply. We do not seek to decisively rule out the relevant application of the Condorcet Jury Theorem. But we do show that careful consideration of the available evidence should make us very skeptical of that application. Consequently, a defense of virtue signalling would need to engage with these findings and show that despite our strong tendencies for conformism, our judgements are sufficiently independent for the Condorcet Jury Theorem to apply.

Women retrospectively reported their mental/emotional health before the pandemic, as well as depression, stress, and substance use as a result of the pandemic at both time points. Linear regression measured cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between mental health and substance use.Results: Pre-COVID-19 reports of poorer mental/emotional health (b = 0.46) were significantly (p < .05) associated with number of substances used to cope with the pandemic. Elevated stress (b = 0.35) and depressive symptoms (b = 0.27) and poorer mental/emotional health (b = 0.14) in April were also significantly related to higher numbers of substances used in May (p < .05).Conclusion: Pregnant women's psychological well-being may be a readily measured indicator substance use risk during crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHOD: Cross-sectional study of both states in the US and counties in NY state. RESULTS: Population density was found to be significantly associated with state-level coronavirus infection and mortality rate (b = 0.49, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.34, 0.64, P < .0001). States that have lower socioeconomic status, lower mean age and denser populations are associated with higher incidence rates. In regard to NY state, counties with a higher percentage of minority residents had higher COVID-19 mortality rates (b = 2.61, 95% CI: 0.36, 4.87, P = 0.023). Larger population cohorts were associated with lower COVID-19 mortality rates after adjusting for other variables in the model (b = −1.39, 95% CI: −2.07, −0.71, P < 0.001). Population density was not significantly associated with COVID-19 mortality rates after adjustment across counties in the NY state. Public ridership was not indicative of cases or mortality across states in the USA; however, it is a significant factor associated with incidence (but not mortality) in NY counties. CONCLUSION: Population density was the only significant predictor of mortality across states in the USA. Lower mean age, lower median household incomes and more densely populated states were at higher risk of COVID-19 infection.

We use structural equation modeling to test the research model with customers of online grocery stores in Indonesia (n = 341). The results indicated that customer perception of risk (i.e., security and privacy concerns) and ease of use positively affect e-satisfaction and trust. There are also positive effects of e-satisfaction and trust on customer engagement which in turn positively affects repurchase intention and positive word-of-mouth.

Cytokine storm is linked to the severity and decreasing the survival among infected patients by COVID-19. The serum levels of Interleukin 6 (IL-6) have been correlated to mortality in COVID-19 cases and could be used as indicator of mortality in COVID-19 cases. The aim of this study was to determine levels of IL-6 and assess its usefulness as indicator of mortality among COVID-19 patients from Mexico. METHODS: A cohort study among 38 adults (28 men, 10 women) was carried out in the Regional High Specialty Hospital of the Yucatan Peninsula in Merida, Yucatan, Mexico. Demographic and clinical biochemistry data were collected. The serum levels of IL-6 were measured in each patient by specific immunoassays. RESULTS: High frequency of mortality (36.84%) was found in the sample. The average age of individuals that non-survive was significantly higher (59.71 ± 13.83 years) than the survival group (43.29 ± 11.80 years). Serum levels of IL-6 were significantly higher in patients that did not survive. A correlation between IL-6 levels with lymphocyte count, LDH, CRP and procaciltonin was found. The optimal cutoff value of IL-6 was 30.95 pg/mL with high sensitivity and specificity.

We developed a predictive model of death from COVID‑19 in an Italian cohort aged 40 years or older. Methods: we conducted a cohort study on prospectively collected data. The cohort included all (n=18,286) swab positive cases ≥40 year-old in patients registered with the Agency for Health Protection (AHP) of Milan up to 27/04/2020. Data on comorbidities were obtained from the chronic condition administrative database of the AHP. A multivariable logistic regression model, including age and gender and the selected conditions, was fitted to predict 30-day mortality risk and internally validated. External validation and recalibration were performed in a cohort of untested subjects with COVID-19 like symptoms. R software was used for the analysis. Results: chronic conditions having the largest model-adjusted odds ratio (OR) of dying within 30 days from COVID-19 infection were chronic heart failure (OR=1.9, 95%CI 1.5-2.5), tumors (OR=1.8, 95%CI 1.4-2.3), complicated diabetes (OR=1.6, 95%CI 1.1-2.2) and dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (OR=1.5, 95%CI 1.0-2.2). Bootstrap-validated c-index was 0.78. The model fitted on the validation cohort had a c-index of 0.93, but required recalibration. With this latter model, at a 10% risk of death threshold, 11% of the AHP population aged 40 years or older is considered at high risk.

Before the COVID 19 pandemic urban parks, as healthy places, were of the most favorable places for urban citizens, but nowadays no vitality is found in urban parks due to the absence of people. The perceived risk seems to affect peoples' decision-making for the visit to urban parks. This study aims to examine the impact of COVID 19 perceived severity and vulnerability on peoples' visit to the urban parks and further exercise avoidance. It is expected that the result of this study would shed light on the people's perception of healthy urban parks to exercise during COVID 19. Design/methodology/approach The participants were recruited from a neighborhood with the greenest and largest parks in Iran that were selected for the study. It was to assure that participants have access to the urban parks within their walkable distance. The mixed-method approach was applied to achieving the research goals. A total of 404 participants attended the survey. A series of semi-structured interviews were conducted to examine the strategies that reduce peoples' worries about using urban parks during the COVID 19. Data were analyzed using SmartPLS. Findings The study hypothesized that peoples' awareness of COVID 19 affects their perceived risk and disease prevention efficiency. Besides, it was hypothesized that perceived risk and efficacy effects outdoor activities worries exercise avoidance and behavioral avoidance in the urban parks. The result of the study supported the research hypothesis. The more knowledge people acquire of COVID 19 and the lack of efficacy of treatments, the higher they will avoid outdoor activities and exercise. The means of knowledge and perceived risk were higher than previously reported studies.

The unknown structure and function of nsp2 have hindered our understanding of its role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we report the crystal structure of the N-terminal of SARS-CoV-2 nsp2 to a high resolution of 1.96 Å. This novel structure contains three zinc fingers, belonging to the C2H2, C4, and C2HC types, respectively. Structure analysis suggests that nsp2 may be involved in binding nucleic acids and regulating intracellular signaling pathways. The binding to single or double-stranded nucleic acids was mainly through the large positively charged region on the surface of nsp2, and K111, K112, K113 were key residues. Our findings lay the foundation for a better understanding of the relationship between structure and function for nsp2.

Few studies of long-term outcome of children with OMS-NB were conducted. This study aimed to review the rate of recovery of neurological symptoms and the long-term neurological outcomes of children with OMS-NB. Methods: This study retrospectively assessed 14 children with OMS-NB diagnosed at Peking University First Hospital from May 2011 to November 2019. Demographic data, neurological symptoms, oncological status and treatments were retrospectively reviewed from the records. Neurological sequelae were recorded by clinical and remote follow-up. Results: During the acute stage, myoclonus and ataxia were observed in all children while opsoclonus was observed in 10/14 children. The median durations of neurological symptoms were 15 months (range, 5-48 months). Approximately 93% (13/14) children revealed neurological sequelae. Significant correlations were as follows: motor retardation with female gender (P<0.001) and residual tumors (P<0.05); language impairment with non-adrenal-gland-located tumors (P<0.05). There were no obvious factors that had a statistical relationship with cognitive disorder or behavioral changes. Conclusions: Children with OMS-NB have favorable outcomes in terms of neurological symptoms. Neurological sequelae occurred in almost all children.

Negative trends in the service market make food companies create competitive products that meet the needs of consumers. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated the need to design new formulations that meet complex requirements and use IT options. The research objective was to create a new approach to the development of products for various types of food industry enterprises. Study objects and methods. The research featured a questionnaire, in which Kemerovo citizens were asked to establish and rank a list of consumer properties for food served at cafes, restaurants, and canteens, as well as to define the ratio of prescription components of model samples and the quality indicators of model samples. The study was based on standard survey methods, sensory and microbiological evaluation, and the Delphi 7software. Results and discussion. The research revealed nomenclature of consumer properties (15 names) of public catering products, which were classified into seven groups of indicators. The following indicators received the highest score (86–100 points): sensory indicators, quality indicators, safety and freshness, appearance, and price. Caloric value proved to be of a relatively low significance (≤ 42 points). The research resulted in a methodology for designing competitive products based on consumer preferences and new application software. Conclusion. Food companies should take into account the degree of significance of particular indicators to create popular and cost-friendly dishes. This research offers a new methodology for designing competitive products based on consumer preferences and the application of the developed program. The consistency and effectiveness of the proposed approach was confirmed by testing the developed dishes at cafes and school canteens. © M.S. Kurakin, A.V. Ozherel’eva, O.G. Motyreva, T.V.

Respiratory illness continues to exert a burden on hajj pilgrims in Makkah. The purpose of this study is to determine the prevalence of respiratory illness and its associated factors among Malaysian hajj pilgrims in 2013 and to describe its preventive measures. Methods. A cross-sectional study was conducted in Makkah and Malaysia during the 2013 hajj season. A self-administered proforma on social demographics, previous experience of hajj or umrah, smoking habits, co-morbid illness and practices of preventive measures against respiratory illness were obtained. Results. A total of 468 proforma were analysed. The prevalence of the respiratory illness was 93.4% with a subset of 78.2% fulfilled the criteria for influenza-like illness (ILI). Most of them (77.8%) had a respiratory illness of <2 weeks duration. Approximately 61.8% were administered antibiotics but only 2.1% of them had been hospitalized. Most of them acquired the infection after a brief stay at Arafat (81.2%). Vaccination coverages for influenza virus and pneumococcal disease were quite high, 65.2% and 59.4%, respectively. For other preventive measures practices, only 31.8% of them practiced good hand hygiene, ∼82.9% of pilgrims used surgical face masks, N95 face masks, dry towels, wet towels or veils as their face masks. Nearly one-half of the respondents (44.4%) took vitamins as their food supplement. Malaysian hajj pilgrims with previous experience of hajj (OR 0.24; 95% CI 0.10–0.56) or umrah (OR 0.19; 95% CI 0.07–0.52) and those who have practiced good hand hygiene (OR 0.35; 95% CI 0.16–0.79) were found to be significantly associated with lower risk of having respiratory illness. Otherwise, pilgrims who had contact with those with respiratory illness (OR 2.61; 95% CI 1.12–6.09) was associated with higher risk. Conclusions.

At the same time, the need constantly arises for more and more new support systems specialized for the needs of a specific target group. One of the most important problems of older people is to record information about emerging health problems. This problem became especially acute during the coronavirus pandemic. Elderly people were isolated and lost the opportunity to attend medical facilities. As a result, many emerging issues are left without due attention. In addition, many older people experience memory problems. If information about the problem is not recorded at the time of its occurrence, the patient may forget important symptoms, their location, strength or duration. This can adversely affect the quality of care that a doctor can provide. The article discusses the development of mobile health troubles self-fixation service for elderly groups, which allows to eliminate or at least reduce these problems. The main functionality of the application is the creation of medical notes, where the user can specify the symptom and the place of its occurrence, give a detailed text description of the problem, attach a photo or voice record, and also select a specialist to contact with this symptom. In addition, through a pre-trained neural network, the service provides the possibility of a comprehensive analysis of several symptoms and a more accurate choice of a doctor. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",2021,"Pchelkin, A.; Gusarova, N.; Dobrenko, N.; Vatyan, A.","3rd International Conference on Futuristic Trends in Network and Communication Technologies, FTNCT 2020",,#covidwho-1265471,,,,,234106096.0

METHODS In an international clinical trial, we randomly assigned patients with very severe ARDS, as indicated by one of three criteria - a ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen (Pao2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) of less than 50 mm Hg for more than 3 hours; a Pao2:Fio2 of less than 80 mm Hg for more than 6 hours; or an arterial blood pH of less than 7.25 with a partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide of at least 60 mm Hg for more than 6 hours - to receive immediate venovenous ECMO (ECMO group) or continued conventional treatment (control group). Crossover to ECMO was possible for patients in the control group who had refractory hypoxemia. The primary end point was mortality at 60 days. RESULTS At 60 days, 44 of 124 patients (35%) in the ECMO group and 57 of 125 (46%) in the control group had died (relative risk, 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.55 to 1.04; P=0.09). Crossover to ECMO occurred a mean (±SD) of 6.5±9.7 days after randomization in 35 patients (28%) in the control group, with 20 of these patients (57%) dying. The frequency of complications did not differ significantly between groups, except that there were more bleeding events leading to transfusion in the ECMO group than in the control group (in 46% vs. 28% of patients; absolute risk difference, 18 percentage points; 95% CI, 6 to 30) as well as more cases of severe thrombocytopenia (in 27% vs. 16%; absolute risk difference, 11 percentage points; 95% CI, 0 to 21) and fewer cases of ischemic stroke (in no patients vs. 5%; absolute risk difference, -5 percentage points; 95% CI, -10 to -2). CONCLUSIONS Among patients with very severe ARDS, 60-day mortality was not significantly lower with ECMO than with a strategy of conventional mechanical ventilation that included ECMO as rescue therapy.

DESIGN: A worldwide, 2-day point prevalence study. SETTING: The study was carried out on June 3, 2020, and July 1, 2020. A total of 212 ICUs in 38 countries participated. Clinicians in each participating ICU completed web-based online surveys. PATIENTS: The ICU patients with coronavirus disease 2019. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The implementation rate for the elements of the ABCDEF bundle, other supportive ICU care measures, and implementation-associated structures were investigated. Data were collected for 262 patients, of whom 47.3% underwent mechanical ventilation and 4.6% were treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

Insights from Molecular Dynamics Simulations,10.1007/s00232-022-00244-y,PMC9101995,35552785.0,no-cc,"Enveloped viruses, in general, have several transmembrane proteins and glycoproteins, which assist the virus in entry and attachment onto the host cells. These proteins also play a significant role in determining the shape and size of the newly formed virus particles. The lipid membrane and the embedded proteins affect each other in non-trivial ways during the course of the viral life cycle. Unraveling the nature of the protein–protein and protein–lipid interactions, under various environmental and physiological conditions, could therefore prove to be crucial in development of therapeutics. Here, we study the M protein of SARS-CoV-2 to understand the effect of temperature on the properties of the protein-membrane system. The membrane-embedded dimeric M proteins were studied using atomistic and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations at temperatures ranging between 10 and 50 °C. While temperature-induced fluctuations are expected to be monotonic, we observe a steady rise in the protein dynamics up to 40 °C, beyond which it surprisingly reverts back to the low-temperature behavior. Detailed investigation reveals disordering of the membrane lipids in the presence of the protein, which induces additional curvature around the transmembrane region. Coarse-grained simulations indicate temperature-dependent aggregation of M protein dimers. Our study clearly indicates that the dynamics of membrane lipids and integral M protein of SARS-CoV-2 enables it to better associate and aggregate only at a certain temperature range (i.e., ~ 30–40 °C). This can have important implications in the protein aggregation and subsequent viral budding/fission processes.

Chan School of Public Health and the Human Vaccines Project (HVP), focuses on studying immunity and the predictability of immuneresponsiveness to vaccines in aging populations. This paper describes the hypotheses and methodological approaches of this new collaborative initiative. Central to our thinking is the idea that predictors of age-related non-communicable diseases are the same as predictors for infectious diseases like COVID-19 and influenza. Fundamental to our approach is to differentiate between chronological, biological and immune age, and to use existing large-scale population cohorts. The latter provide well-typed phenotypic data on individuals' health status over time, readouts of routine clinical biochemical biomarkers to determine biological age, and bio-banked plasma samples to deep phenotype humoral immune responses as biomarkers of immune age. The first phase of the program involves 1. the exploration of biological age, humoral biomarkers of immune age, and genetics in a large multigenerational cohort, and 2. the subsequent development of models of immunity in relation to health status in a second, prospective cohort of an aging population. In the second phase, vaccine responses and efficacy of licensed COVID-19 vaccines in the presence and absence of influenza-, pneumococcal- and pertussis vaccines routinely offered to elderly, will be studied in older aged participants of prospective population-based cohorts in different geographical locations who will be selected for representing distinct biological and immune ages.

Analysis of data collected from 295 chatbot users in Wuhan and Chongqing reveals that personalization, enjoyment, learning, and condition are positively related to user experience and user satisfaction. However, voice interaction fails to devote to citizens’ user experience and user satisfaction. Thus, government agencies and their AI service contractors should enhance the functions and systems of mental health chatbots to ensure citizens’ user experience and user satisfaction. Also, they should more positively promote the use of mental health chatbots during the public health emergency.

They illustrate the perils of precipitate publication, inadequate peer-reviewing and co-authorship without proper assumption of responsibility. A period of crisis such as that in existence during the COVID-19 pandemic calls for high-quality research that is robustly evaluated.

In addition, the unprecedented power of HTS technologies has enabled the analysis of intra-host viral diversity and quasispecies dynamics in relation to important biological questions on viral transmission, vaccine resistance and host jumping. HTS also enables the rapid identification of both known and potentially new viruses from field and clinical samples, thus adding new tools to the fields of viral discovery and metagenomics. Bioinformatics has been central to the rise of HTS applications because new algorithms and software tools are continually needed to process and analyse the large, complex datasets generated in this rapidly evolving area. In this paper, the authors give a brief overview of the main bioinformatics tools available for viral genomic research, with a particular emphasis on HTS technologies and their main applications.

In contrast, pathogens that escape the immune response elicited upon vaccination are rare. Previous studies showed that the prophylactic character of vaccines, the multiplicity of epitopes to which the immune system responds within a host, and their diversity between hosts delay the evolution and emergence of escape mutants in a vaccinated population. By extending previous mathematical models, we find that, depending on the cost of the escape mutations, there even exist critical levels of immune response diversity that completely prevent vaccine escape. Furthermore, to quantify the potential for vaccine escape below these critical levels, we propose a concept of escape depth which measures the fraction of escape mutants that can spread in a vaccinated population.

Reducing the time between symptom onset and COVID-19 testing and isolation allows enhanced outbreak control. The purpose of this study is to describe the time taken by participants to present to general practitioner-led (GP) respiratory clinics for assessment following the development of symptoms, and to explore associations between demographic and geographic characteristics and the time to presentation. A total of 314,148 participants, who were assessed in GP respiratory clinics between 1 February and 31 August 2021, were included in the analysis. The median age of participants at presentation was 33 years (interquartile range, IQR: 15-49). The median time from development of symptoms to presentation for assessment at GP respiratory clinics was 2 days (IQR: 1-3). Participants were more likely to present within one day of symptom onset if they were aged between 15 and 64 years (43.4%), lived in urban areas (40.9%) or were non-Indigenous (40.2%).

We sought to define the etiology, clinical presentation, time course and outcomes of children presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) with cutaneous manifestations shortly after the first pandemic peak of COVID-19 in Spain. METHODS: Prospective, observational study in children <15 years of age evaluated for skin lesions in the ED of three pediatric hospitals. Children underwent a comprehensive work-up including SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and PCR, and serology and PCR tests for other viruses and bacteria. A one-month follow-up visit was conducted. RESULTS: From April 14 through May 8, 2020 we enrolled 62 children. Of those 34 had acro-ischemic skin lesions and 28 a variety of skin rashes. Overall 40% of children had mild systemic symptoms. Children with chilblains were older, had pain more frequently and more prolonged duration of skin lesions, while those with non-specific rashes had fever more frequently. Lesions were resolved in 75% of children at follow-up. Five patients demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and none tested positive by PCR. Three additional patients tested positive by PCR for rhinovirus, M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae. CONCLUSIONS: The number of ED visits for chilblains, which are rare in pediatrics, was high soon after the first peak of COVID-19 in Spain.

Despite the enormous progress in structure elucidation, the Mpro's structure-function relationship remains poorly understood. Recently, a peptidomimetic inhibitor has entered clinical trial; however, small-molecule orally available antiviral drugs have yet to be developed. Intrigued by a long-standing controversy regarding the existence of an inactive state, we explored the proton-coupled dynamics of the Mpros of SARS-CoV-2 and the closely related SARS-CoV using a newly developed continuous constant pH molecular dynamics (MD) method and microsecond fixed-charge all-atom MD simulations. Our data supports a general base mechanism for Mpro's proteolytic function. The simulations revealed that protonation of His172 alters a conserved interaction network that upholds the oxyanion loop, leading to a partial collapse of the conserved S1 pocket, consistent with the first and controversial crystal structure of SARS-CoV Mpro determined at pH 6. Interestingly, a natural flavonoid binds SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in the close proximity to a conserved cysteine (Cys44), which is hyper-reactive according to the CpHMD titration. This finding offers an exciting new opportunity for small-molecule targeted covalent inhibitor design. Our work represents a first step toward the mechanistic understanding of the proton-coupled structure-dynamics-function relationship of CoV Mpros; the proposed strategy of designing small-molecule covalent inhibitors may help accelerate the development of orally available broad-spectrum antiviral drugs to stop the current pandemic and prevent future outbreaks.",2020,"Verma, Neha; Henderson, Jack A; Shen, Jana",J Am Chem Soc,,#1065801,,,,,229281679.0

In this study, we reviewed all psychiatric adverse effects with hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients, as well as in other indications, reported in VigiBase, the World Health Organization’s (WHO) global database of individual case safety reports. METHODS: First, we analyzed all psychiatric adverse effects, including suicide, of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients reported to 16 June 2020. We also performed disproportionality analysis to investigate the risk of reporting psychiatric disorders with hydroxychloroquine compared with remdesivir, tocilizumab, or lopinavir/ritonavir prescribed in COVID-19 patients. We used reporting odds ratios (RORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to calculate disproportionality. Second, we sought to examine the psychiatric safety profile of hydroxychloroquine in other indications (before 2020). RESULTS: Among the 1754 reports with hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients, we found 56 psychiatric adverse effects. Half of these adverse effects were serious, including four completed suicides, three cases of intentional self-injury, and 12 cases of psychotic disorders with hallucinations. Compared with remdesivir, tocilizumab, or lopinavir/ritonavir, the use of hydroxychloroquine was associated with an increased risk of reporting psychiatric disorders (ROR 6.27, 95% CI 2.74–14.35). Before 2020, suicide was the main cause of death among all adverse drug reactions reported with hydroxychloroquine, followed by cardiac adverse effects (cardiomyopathy) and respiratory failure. CONCLUSIONS: This pharmacovigilance analysis suggests that COVID-19 patients exposed to hydroxychloroquine experienced serious psychiatric disorders, and, among these patients, some committed suicide.

The aim of this study was to investigate the difference in HRCT scan findings depending on the time after onset of the disease. The objective of the study is to identify and compare findings of HRCT scan at different time points after onset of the disease. METHODS: A total of 224 patients, scanned over a period of 2 months, were placed in one of the four groups at the time of their scan depending on the days lapsed after their symptoms appeared. All scans were carried out on the same machine. Findings in each group were recorded and compared. A finding showing significant difference between groups indicates its importance in describing the course of the disease. Analysis was done on SPSS 23. RESULTS: Ground glass opacities in posterior segments of one or more lobes was the most common feature and had a significant association with first 5 days of the disease (p=.027). Interlobular thickening and subpleural reticulation, are found between 3-5 days or later in the course of the disease (p=.000). CONCLUSION: Ground glass opacities located in posterior segments are the predominant feature in patients who are scanned up to 5 days after their symptoms appear.

Mental health curriculum interventions using social media have been associated with positive implementation outcomes. This study aimed to investigate whether such an intervention significantly improves adolescent mental health literacy and is associated with positive implementation outcome measures. METHODS: This study employed a quasi-experimental design, comparing the before-and-after difference between the intervention group (n(1)=77) and the control group (n(1)=76). A mental health literacy module was delivered using social media. Data were collected using validated questionnaires. Effect size and difference-in-differences model calculations (and associated 95% confidence intervals, CI) were conducted alongside other descriptive analyses. RESULTS: The estimated intervention effect size and difference-in-differences estimates were greater than zero. The effect was greater in the intervention than in the control group (p<0.05) despite sex and age differences. The effect size estimate provided by Cohen’s d and Hedges’ g values was medium-to-large (d/g=0.429–0.767, p<0.05). The difference-in-differences reflected a significant effect (DID=0.348, CI: 0.154–0.542, p<0.001) in increasing mental health literacy despite differences associated with sex, age, and school grade. The intervention program was acceptable, appropriate, feasible, and satisfactory, and more than 80% of participants said they agree to completely agree with these implementation outcomes. Resources and personal and family-related factors were among the perceived influencing factors determining the effectiveness and implementation outcome measures. CONCLUSION: The intervention program effectively improved the mental health literacy of adolescents. It has been highlighted that social media interventions for mental health promotion could be practical and scalable; however, there is a need to take into account socio-demographic differences and barriers to inclusion/compliance.",2022-05-03,"Hassen, Hailemariam Mamo; Behera, Manas Ranjan; Jena, Pratap Kumar; Dewey, Rebecca S; Disassa, Getachew Abeshu",J Multidiscip Healthc,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/f12c56b19cff0ae64543fecaf9c916526c4910f0.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC9078434.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.2147/jmdh.s361212; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35535244/,248536405.0

We examined the integrated relationships of local (nasopharyngeal) and systemic (serum) responses with bronchiolitis morbidities. METHODS In a multicenter prospective cohort study of infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis, we applied a network analysis approach to identify distinct networks (modules)-clusters of densely interconnected metabolites-of the nasopharyngeal and serum metabolome. We examined their individual and integrated relationships with acute severity (defined by positive pressure ventilation [PPV] use) and asthma development by age 5 years. RESULTS In 140 infants, we identified 285 nasopharyngeal and 639 serum metabolites. Network analysis revealed 7 nasopharyngeal and 8 serum modules. At the individual module-level, nasopharyngeal-amino acid, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and carnitine modules were associated with higher risk of PPV use (r>0.20; P<0.001), while serum-carnitine, amino acid and glycerophosphorylcholine (GPC)/glycerophosphorylethanolamine (GPE) modules were associated with lower risk (all r<- 0.20; P<0.05). The integrated analysis for PPV use revealed consistent findings-e.g., nasopharyngeal-TCA (adjOR 2.87, 95%CI 1.68-12.2) and serum-GPC/GPE (adjOR 0.54, 95%CI 0.38-0.80) modules-and an additional module-serum-glucose-alanine cycle module (adjOR 0.69, 95%CI 0.56-0.86). With asthma risk, there were no individual associations but there were integrated associations (e.g., nasopharyngeal-carnitine module; adjOR 1.48, 95%CI 1.11-1.99).

j9tyd0hi,,WHO,"RNA Drugs and RNA Targets for Small Molecules: Principles, Progress, and Challenges",,,,unk,"RNA-based therapies, including RNA molecules as drugs and RNA-targeted small molecules, offer unique opportunities to expand the range of therapeutic targets. Various forms of RNAs may be used to selectively act on proteins, transcripts, and genes that cannot be targeted by conventional small molecules or proteins. Although development of RNA drugs faces unparalleled challenges, many strategies have been developed to improve RNA metabolic stability and intracellular delivery. A number of RNA drugs have been approved for medical use, including aptamers (e.g., pegaptanib) that mechanistically act on protein target and small interfering RNAs (e.g., patisiran and givosiran) and antisense oligonucleotides (e.g., inotersen and golodirsen) that directly interfere with RNA targets. Furthermore, guide RNAs are essential components of novel gene editing modalities, and mRNA therapeutics are under development for protein replacement therapy or vaccination, including those against unprecedented severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus pandemic. Moreover, functional RNAs or RNA motifs are highly structured to form binding pockets or clefts that are accessible by small molecules. Many natural, semisynthetic, or synthetic antibiotics (e.g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, macrolides, oxazolidinones, and phenicols) can directly bind to ribosomal RNAs to achieve the inhibition of bacterial infections. Therefore, there is growing interest in developing RNA-targeted small-molecule drugs amenable to oral administration, and some (e.g., risdiplam and branaplam) have entered clinical trials. Here, we review the pharmacology of novel RNA drugs and RNA-targeted small-molecule medications, with a focus on recent progresses and strategies. Challenges in the development of novel druggable RNA entities and identification of viable RNA targets and selective small-molecule binders are discussed.

Our previous mechanistic and neuroimaging work in young rhesus monkeys linked the central nucleus of the amygdala to AT and its underlying neural circuit. METHODS: Here, we used laser capture microscopy and RNA sequencing in 47 young rhesus monkeys to investigate AT's molecular underpinnings by focusing on neurons from the lateral division of the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeL). RNA sequencing identified numerous AT-related CeL transcripts, and we used immunofluorescence (n = 3) and tract-tracing (n = 2) methods in a different sample of monkeys to examine the expression, distribution, and projection pattern of neurons expressing one of these transcripts. RESULTS: We found 555 AT-related transcripts, 14 of which were confirmed with high statistical confidence (false discovery rate < .10), including protein kinase C delta (PKCÎ´), a CeL microcircuit cell marker implicated in rodent threat processing. We characterized PKCÎ´ neurons in the rhesus CeL, compared its distribution with that of the mouse, and demonstrated that a subset of these neurons project to the laterodorsal bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that CeL PKCÎ´ is associated with primate anxiety, provides evidence of a CeL to laterodorsal bed nucleus of the stria terminalis circuit that may be relevant to understanding human anxiety, and points to specific molecules within this circuit that could serve as potential treatment targets for anxiety disorders.",2020,"Kovner, Rothem; Souaiaia, Tade; Fox, Andrew S; French, Delores A; Goss, Cooper E; Roseboom, Patrick H; Oler, Jonathan A; Riedel, Marissa K; Fekete, Eva M; Fudge, Julie L; Knowles, James A; Kalin, Ned H",Biol. psychiatr,,#32709417,,,,,213470006.0

This study investigates patient perceptions concerning attendance for planned orthopaedic surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 250 adult patients from the elective orthopaedic waiting list at Cardiff and Vale University Health Board were telephoned during lockdown. They were risk stratified for COVID-19 based on British Orthopaedic Association guidance and a discussion was held to determine patient willingness to proceed with surgery. The primary outcome measure was patients' willingness to proceed. RESULTS Of the total number telephoned, 196 patients were included in the study, with a mean age of 57.4 years; 129 patients were willing to attend for surgery, leaving over one-third wishing to cancel or defer. The most frequent reason given for not wishing to attend was fear of contracting COVID-19. There was a statistically significant difference in the willingness to proceed observed with increasing clinical risk (χ2(3) = 50.073, p = .000) with almost double the expected count of unwilling to proceed in the high and very high risk groups, equalled by half the expected count in the low risk group. DISCUSSION This study illustrates the variable and personal decisions that patients are making about orthopaedic care because of COVID-19.

However, lack of clarity around what is known and unknown regarding droplet and aerosol generation in dentistry (including oral surgery and extractions), and their relative risk to patients and the dental team, necessitates a review of evidence relating to specific dental procedures. This review is part of a wider body of research exploring the evidence on bioaerosols in dentistry and involves detailed consideration of the risk of contamination in relation to oral surgery. METHODS: A comprehensive search of Medline (OVID), Embase (OVID), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Scopus, Web of Science, LILACS and ClinicalTrials.Gov was conducted using key terms and MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) words relating to the review questions. Methodological quality including sensitivity was assessed using a schema developed to measure quality aspects of studies using a traffic light system to allow inter- and intra-study overview and comparison. A narrative synthesis was conducted for assessment of the included studies and for the synthesis of results. RESULTS: Eleven studies on oral surgery (including extractions) were included in the review. They explored microbiological (bacterial and fungal) and blood (visible and/or imperceptible) contamination at the person level (patients, operators and assistants) and/or at a wider environmental level, using settle plates, chemiluminescence reagents or air samplers; all within 1 m of the surgical site. Studies were of generally low to medium quality and highlighted an overall risk of contaminated aerosol, droplet and splatter generation during oral surgery procedures, most notably during removal of impacted teeth using rotatory handpieces. Risk of contamination and spread was increased by factors, including proximity to the operatory site, longer duration of treatment, higher procedural complexity, non-use of an extraoral evacuator and areas involving more frequent contact during treatment. CONCLUSION: A risk of contamination (microbiological, visible and imperceptible blood) to patients, dental team members and the clinical environment is present during oral surgery procedures, including routine extractions. However, the extent of contamination has not been explored fully in relation to time and distance. Variability across studies with regards to the analysis methods used and outcome measures makes it difficult to draw robust conclusions.

Although the specific cause is frequently evident from the history or from the immediate events, such as a trauma, extraordinary physical exertion, or a recent infection, sometimes there are hidden risk factors that have to be identified. For instance, individuals with sickle cell trait (SCT) have been reported to be at increased risk for rare conditions, including rhabdomyolysis. Moreover, there have been a few case reports of SARS-CoV-2 infection-related rhabdomyolysis. CASE REPORT: We present a case of a patient affected by unknown SCT and admitted with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, who suffered non-traumatic non-exertional rhabdomyolysis leading to acute kidney injury (AKI), requiring acute hemodialysis (HD). The patients underwent 13 dialysis session, of which 12 were carried out using an HFR-Supra H dialyzer. He underwent kidney biopsy, where rhabdomyolysis injury was ascertained. No viral traces were found on kidney biopsy samples. The muscle biopsy showed the presence of an “open nucleolus” in the muscle cell, which was consistent with virus-infected cells.

In the absence of effective treatments, it is necessary to search for new therapies and therapeutic targets. Platelets play a fundamental role in respiratory disorders resulting from viral infections, being the first line of defense against viruses and essential in maintaining lung function. The direct application of platelet lysate (PL) obtained from the platelet-rich plasma of healthy donors could help in the improvement of the patient due its anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, antifibrotic, and repairing effects. This work evaluates PL nebulization by analyzing its levels of growth factors and its biological activity on lung fibroblast cell cultures, besides describing a scientific basis for its use in this kind of pathology. The data of the work suggest that the molecular levels and biological activity of the PL are maintained after nebulization. Airway administration would allow acting directly on the lung tissue modulating inflammation and stimulating reparative processes on key structures such as the alveolocapillary barrier, improving the disease and sequels. The protocol developed in this work is a first step for the study of nebulized PL both in animal experimentation and in clinical trials.",2021,"Beitia, Maider; Delgado, Diego; Sánchez, Pello; Vallejo de la Cueva, Ana; Cugat, José Ramón; Sánchez, Mikel",Int. j. mol. sci.

A Meta-analysis,,,,unk,"Previous researches on the association between proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) use and the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 has generated inconsistent findings. Therefore, this meta-analysis was conducted to clarify the outcome in patients who take PPIs. Eight articles with more than 268,683 subjects were included. PPI use was not associated with increased or decreased risk of COVID-19 infection (OR:3.16, 95% CI=0.74-13.43, P=0.12) or mortality risk of COVID-19 patients (OR=1.91, 95% CI=0.86-4.24, P=0.11).

Since the outbreak began in March 2020, India has reported 4.77 lakh Coronavirus deaths, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The innate RNA interference (RNAi) pathway, on the other hand, allows for the development of nucleic acid-based antiviral drugs in which complementary small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) mediate the post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) of target mRNA. Therefore, in this current study, the potential of RNAi was harnessed to construct siRNA molecules that target the consensus regions of specific structural proteins associated genes of SARS-CoV-2, such as the envelope protein gene (E), membrane protein gene (M), nucleocapsid phosphoprotein gene (N), and surface glycoprotein gene (S) which are important for the viral pathogenesis. Conserved sequences of 811 SARS-CoV-2 strains from around India were collected to design 21 nucleotides long siRNA duplex based on various computational algorithms and parameters targeting E, M, N and S genes. The proposed siRNA molecules possessed sufficient nucleotide-based and other features for effective gene silencing and BLAST results revealed that siRNAs' targets have no significant matches across the whole human genome. Hence, siRNAs were found to have no off-target effects on the genome, ruling out the possibility of off-target silencing. Finally, out of 157 computationally identified siRNAs, only 4 effective siRNA molecules were selected for each target gene which is proposed to exert the best action based on GC content, free energy of folding, free energy of binding, melting temperature, heat capacity and molecular docking analysis with Human AGO2 protein.

Chronic pain, with a prevalence of 20-30% is the major cause of human suffering worldwide, because effective, specific and safe therapies have yet to be developed. It is unevenly distributed among sexes, with women experiencing more pain and suffering. Chronic pain can be anatomically and phenomenologically dissected into three separable but interacting pathways, a lateral 'painfulness' pathway, a medial 'suffering' pathway and a descending pain inhibitory pathway. One may have pain(fullness) without suffering and suffering without pain(fullness). Pain sensation leads to suffering via a cognitive, emotional and autonomic processing, and is expressed as anger, fear, frustration, anxiety and depression. The medial pathway overlaps with the salience and stress networks, explaining that behavioural relevance or meaning determines the suffering associated with painfulness. Genetic and epigenetic influences trigger chronic neuroinflammatory changes which are involved in transitioning from acute to chronic pain. Based on the concept of the Bayesian brain, pain (and suffering) can be regarded as the consequence of an imbalance between the two ascending and the descending pain inhibitory pathways under control of the reward system. The therapeutic clinical implications of this simple pain model are obvious. After categorizing the working mechanisms of each of the available treatments (pain killers, psychopharmacology, psychotherapy, neuromodulation, psychosurgery, spinal cord stimulation) to 1 or more of the 3 pathways, a rational combination can be proposed of activating the descending pain inhibitory pathways in combination with inhibition of the medial and lateral pathway, so as to rebalance the pain (and suffering) pathways.",2021-08-16,"De Ridder, Dirk; Adhia, Divya; Vanneste, Sven",Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2021.08.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34411559/,237056789.0

However as of 2017, only 9% of the 9 billion tons of plastic ever produced had been recycled leaving large amounts of plastics to contaminate the environment, resulting in important negative health and economic impacts. Curbing this trend is a major challenge that requires urgent and multifaceted action. Based on scientific and gray literature mainly published during the last 10 years, this review summarizes key solutions currently in use globally that have the potential to address at scale the plastic and microplastic contaminations from source to sea. They include technologies to control plastics in solid wastes (i.e. mechanical and chemical plastic recycling or incineration), in-stream (i.e. booms and clean-up boats, trash racks, and sea bins), and microplastics (i.e. stormwater, municipal wastewater and drinking water treatment), as well as general policy measures (i.e. measures to support the informal sector, bans, enforcement of levies, voluntary measures, extended producer responsibility, measures to enhance recycling and guidelines, standards and protocols to guide activities and interventions) to reduce use, reuse, and recycle plastics and microplastics in support of the technological options. The review discusses the effectiveness, capital expenditure, and operation and maintenance costs of the different technologies, the cost of implementation of policy measures, and the suitability of each solution under various conditions. This guidance is expected to help policymakers and practitioners address, in a sustainable and cost-efficient way, the plastic and microplastic management problem using technologies and policy instruments suitable in their local context.

RESULTS: Seven cross-sectional and one cohort studies with a total number of 13,209 participants were included in the final analyses. Each 2-point increment in the score of adherence to the MedDiet was associated with 0.009 (95% CI: 0.002, 0.016; I2 = 34%, n = 7), 0.006 (95% CI: 0.001, 0.012; I2 = 34%, n = 7), 0.005 (95% CI: 0.003, 0.007; I2 = 1%, n = 4), 0.005 (95% CI: 0.002, 0.008; I2 = 0%, n = 3), and 0.007 (95% CI: 0.005, 0.009; I2 = 0%, n = 4) gr/cm2 higher BMD of lumbar spine, femoral neck, hip, trochanter, and whole body, respectively.

An inferior social safety net and American conservatism systematically correlate with the realization and effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing and mask wearing from April to September. Economic inequality and weak social safety nets drive the economically vulnerable to work outside their homes, increasing mobility and reducing social distancing during early stages of the pandemic. Conservative ideology, anti-intellectualism, and evangelicalism drive people to politicize social distancing and mask wearing. Both factors predict a premature reopening in many states, and have a strong correlation with the drifting of COVID-19 epicenters to red states over the course of 2020.

To fill this knowledge gap, this study conducted a field trial on the SARS-CoV-2 presence in various wastewater facilities after the end of the COVID-19 epidemics in Beijing. The result showed that the wastewater treatment facility is a large SARS-CoV-2 repository. The viral RNA was still present in hospital sewage for 15 days and was continually detected in municipal WWTPs for more than 19 days after the end of the local COVID-19 epidemics. The T(90) values of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA in raw wastewater were 17.17–8.42 days in the wastewater at 4 ℃ and 26 ℃, respectively, meaning that the decay rates of low titer viruses in raw sewage were much faster.

zntrvzfz,,WHO,Fashion in ‘crisis’: consumer activism and brand (ir)responsibility in lockdown,,,,unk,"The Covid-19 pandemic precipitated an ‘existential crisis’ in the global fashion industry. The effects of the crisis on the retail sector resulted in many brands deferring or cancelling orders from supplier factories without paying workers, which had an instant and calamitous impact on the lives of garment workers in the global South. While activist organizations were quick to launch campaigns demanding that fashion brands #PayUp and take responsibility for their producers, these calls seemed futile in the face of fashion supply chains that have long been structured in ways that absolve brands of responsibility. The stories of worker exploitation and abuse in the garment industry that emerged during the pandemic were not discussed as effects of global capitalism, but rather were recast as evidence of a world suddenly in ‘crisis.’ In this article, we reflect on how the language of ‘crisis’ adopted in the early months of the pandemic produced particular modes and instruments of (ir)responsibility. We present an analysis of the effects of the pandemic on the global fashion industry, as well as the #PayUp and #WeWearAustralian campaigns, and argue that the exceptionalism underpinning the crisis discourse has both diffused and narrowed responsibility for garment worker exploitation, reiterating the very racialised inequalities that allow such exploitation to occur in the first place.",2021,"Khan, Rimi Richards Harriette",Cultural Studies,,#covidwho-1216523,,,,,233731548.0
nrxq18lz,,WHO,Molecular characterization of interactions between the D614G variant of SARS-CoV-2 S-protein and neutralizing antibodies: A computational approach,,,,unk,"The D614G variant of SARS-CoV-2 S-protein emerged in early 2020 and quickly became the dominant circulating strain in Europe and its environs. The variant was characterized by the higher viral load, which is not associated with disease severity, higher incorporation into the virion, and high cell entry via ACE-2 and TMPRSS2. Previous strains of the coronavirus and the current SARS-CoV-2 have demonstrated the selection of mutations as a mechanism of escaping immune responses. In this study, we used molecular dynamics simulation and MM-PBSA binding energy analysis to provide insights into the behaviour of the D614G S-protein at the molecular level and describe the neutralization mechanism of this variant. Our results show that the D614G S-protein adopts distinct conformational dynamics which is skewed towards the open-state conformation more than the closed-state conformation of the wild-type S-protein. Residue-specific variation of amino acid flexibility and domain-specific RMSD suggest that the mutation causes an allosteric conformational change in the RBD. Evaluation of the interaction energies between the S-protein and neutralizing antibodies show that the mutation may enhance, reduce or not affect the neutralizing interactions depending on the neutralizing antibody, especially if it targets the RBD. The results of this study have shed insights into the behaviour of the D614G S-protein at the molecular level and provided a glimpse of the neutralization mechanism of this variant.",2021,"Kwarteng, Alexander; Asiedu, Ebenezer; Sylverken, Augustina Angelina; Larbi, Amma; Sakyi, Samuel Asamoah; Asiedu, Samuel Opoku",Infect Genet Evol,,#covidwho-1155584,,,,,232327172.0

RESEARCH QUESTION: Are people with asthma at a higher risk of being infected, hospitalised or of poorer clinical outcomes from COVID-19? METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis based on five main databases including the WHO COVID-19 database between December 1, 2019 to July 11, 2021 on studies with a control (non-asthma) group was conducted. Prevalence and risk ratios were pooled using Sidik-Jonkman random effects meta-analyses. FINDINGS: Fifty-one studies with an 8.08% (95% CI 6.87–9.30) pooled prevalence of people with asthma among COVID-19 positive cases. The risk ratios were 0.83 (95% CI 0.73–0.95, p=0.01) for acquiring COVID-19; 1.18 (95% CI 0.98–1.42, p=0.08) for hospitalisation; 1.21 (95% CI 0.97–1.51, p=0.09) for ICU admission; 1.06 (95% CI 0.82–1.36, p=0.65) for ventilator use and 0.94 (95% CI 0.76–1.17; p=0.58) for mortality for people with asthma.

Research has shown that intestinal microbiota is very important for neurodevelopment. Studies regarding the association between gut microbiota and neurodevelopment outcome in asphyxiated newborns remain scarce. Objective: To study the microbial characteristics of asphyxiated neonates within 1 week of life and to investigate their relationship with neural development at 6 months. Methods: The feces produced on days 1, 3, and 5, and the clinical data of full-term neonates with asphyxia and without asphyxia, delivered from March 2019 to October 2020 at Peking University First Hospital, were collected. We used 16S ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid amplicon sequencing to detect the intestinal microbiota of asphyxiated neonates and neonates in the control group. We followed up asphyxiated neonates for 6 months and used the Ages and Stages Questionnaires-3 (ASQ-3) to evaluate their development. Results: A total of 45 neonates were enrolled in the study group and 32 were enrolled in the control group. On day 1, the diversity and richness of the microflora of the study group were more than those of the control group. Non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis showed significant differences in the microbiota of the two groups on days 1, 3, and 5. At the phylum level, the main microflora of the two groups were not different. At the genus level, the study group had increased relative abundance of Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1, Lachnoclostridium, Fusicatenibacter, etc. on day 1. On day 3, the relative abundance of Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1, Fusicatenibacter, etc. was still greater than that of the control group, and the relative abundance of Staphylococcus was less than that of the control group. On day 5, the relative abundance of Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1 and Lachnoclostridium was still higher than that of the control group, and the relative abundance of Dubosiella in the study group was significantly increased. At the species level, on day 3, the relative abundance of Staphylococcus caprae in the study group was less than that in the control group. Linear discriminant analysis effect size showed that the microbiota of the study group mainly consisted of Lachnospiraceae and Clostridia on day 1 and Clostridia on day 3. In the control group, Staphylococcus was the dominant bacterium on day 3. Neonates in the study group were followed up for 6 months, and the communication score of ASQ-3 was negatively correlated with the relative abundance of Lachnospiraceae and Clostridia on day 1. Conclusion: The diversity and richness of the microbiota of asphyxiated neonates on the first day of life were significantly increased and mainly consisted of pathogenic flora. Lachnospiraceae and Clostridia found in neonates with asphyxia on day 1 of life may be related to neural development at 6 months.",2021-08-23,"Zhang, Xiaojiao; Liu, Lili; Bai, Wei; Han, Ying; Hou, Xinlin",Front Pediatr,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/2d62e605a8c7c2e4ee5ac446fc5541ed9d48908b.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8419515.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8419515/,

The primary outcome was COVID-19 severity at index ED visit, while the secondary outcome was peak disease severity over the course of illness. Fifty-two COVID-19 patients were enrolled. C3a (p = 0.018), C3a/C3 ratio (p = 0.002), and sC5b-9/C3 ratio (p = 0.021) were significantly elevated in with severe disease at ED presentation. Over the course of illness, C3a (p = 0.028) and C3a/C3 ratio (p = 0.003) were highest in the moderate severity group. In multivariate regression controlled for confounders, complement hyperactivation failed to predict progression to severe disease. C3a, C3a/C3 ratio, and sC5b-9/C3 ratio were correlated positively with numerous inflammatory biomarkers, fibrinogen, and VWF:Ag, and negatively with plasminogen and ADAMTS13 activity. We found evidence of complement hyperactivation in COVID-19, associated with hyperinflammation and thrombotic microangiopathy. Complement inhibition should be further investigated for potential benefit in patients displaying a hyperinflammatory and microangiopathic phenotype.",2021,"Henry, Brandon Michael; Szergyuk, Ivan; de Oliveira, Maria Helena Santos; Lippi, Giuseppe; Benoit, Justin L; Vikse, Jens; Benoit, Stefanie W",J Med Virol,,#covidwho-1235670,,,,,234360438.0

Universities are asked to reflect on the consequences and develop strategies to prepare their medical students for a digitalized health care sector. The current state of research does not systematically record the associated activities of individual medical faculties in Germany. Objective: This study was designed to survey the status-quo of how German medical faculties view the digitization progress and to what extend digital capability building is already integrated into the curricula. Methods: A questionnaire with three focus areas was developed: Firstly, the general view of the medical faculties on digitization; secondly, concrete measures to prepare students for digital change and thirdly, the overarching organizational and regulatory conditions. The data was collected through short, questionnaire-based telephone interviews among those responsible for the curriculum at their faculty. The datasets collected were anonymized and statistically evaluated. Results: 30 interviews were conducted. The majority of faculty representatives agreed that digitization will change the role of physicians (87% agreement). Changes caused by individual digitization trends were however viewed to be less likely, e.g., whether medical expertise will become less important due to digital assistance systems (20% agreement), whether physician positions will be replaced by robots and algorithms (7% agreement), or whether hierarchies in hospitals will flatten (13% agreement). Digitization was seen to be of major importance for medical studies (93% agreement). Associated content should be given a higher priority in the curriculum (87% agreement). Two-thirds of faculty representatives believed that overarching institutions such as politics and medical associations ought to have more concrete plans for implementing the digital transformation and that innovations should be implemented in practice faster. Conclusion: While most faculty representatives attach great importance to the digitization of the health care system for university education, various questions about structural teaching measures to prepare students for the digital change show that there is no uniform education of medical students for a digitized health care system. We were also able to show that most faculty representatives are dissatisfied with the regulatory and organizational conditions of digitization in the medical sector.",2021-11-15,"Neumann, Maximilian; Fehring, Leonard; Kinscher, Kristian; Truebel, Hubert; Dahlhausen, Florian; Ehlers, Jan P.; Mondritzki, Thomas; Boehme, Philip",GMS J Med Educ,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/90f56ff89c080b5bc1f6c2522638f20fe4555cfa.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8675372.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34957329/; https://doi.org/10.3205/zma001520,245444416.0

Indeed, diabetes has been associated with a higher risk of infections and higher risk of developing severe forms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) related pneumonia. Diabetic patients often present associated comorbidities such as obesity, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases, and complications of diabetes, including chronic kidney disease, vasculopathy and relative immune dysfunction, all of which make them more susceptible to infectious complications. Moreover, they often present low-grade inflammation with increased circulating interleukin levels, endothelial susceptibility to inflammation and dysfunction, and finally, hyperglycemia, which increases this risk. Additionally, corticosteroids, which count among the few medications which showed benefit on survival and mechanical ventilation requirement in COVID-19 pneumonia in large randomized controlled trials, are associated to new onsets of diabetes, and metabolic disorders in patients with previous history of diabetes. Finally, SARS-CoV-2 via the alternate effects of the renin-angiotensin system, mediated by the angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2, was also associated with insulin resistance in key tissues involved in glucose homeostasis, such as liver, skeletal muscles, and adipose tissue; and also, with impaired insulin secretion by pancreatic β-cells. In this work, we reviewed all elements which may help understand how diabetes affects patients with COVID-19, how treatments affect outcomes in patients with COVID-19, how they may cause new onsets of diabetes, and finally review how SARS-CoV-2 may inherently be a risk factor of developing diabetes, through immune-mediated diabetogenic mechanisms.",2021-10-15,"Sabri, Sophia; Bourron, Olivier; Phan, Franck; Nguyen, Lee S",World J Diabetes,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/d730f4ed6198395a858b9403ff0b159988b603f7.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8554367.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.4239/wjd.v12.i10.1674; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34754370/,240829163.0

hkqmex3o,,WHO,Female Surfers Riding the Crest of a 'New Wave' of Irish National Identity,,,,unk,"With surfing debuting at the 2021 Tokyo Olympics (postponed from summer 2020 due to the COVID 19 global pandemic) it is timely to consider surfing and the national identifications women in Ireland may have with this sport. As Lee Bush states, 'with so little scholarship on surfing women, descriptive studies are needed as a foundation for launching future interpretive and critical studies.' Twelve women who surf in Ireland spoke about the links their surfing may or may not have with their national identity. Previous academic inquiry on links between national identity and sport on the island of Ireland has almost exclusively focused on men's experiences of team sports and issues of 'Irishness'. 'Irishness' is globally recognised and stereotypically linked to traditional and indigenous Irish sports such as Gaelic football and a range of other cultural activities. Research into women's sport participation has largely been restricted to the study of soccer in the Republic of Ireland, and gendered evaluations of various lifestyle and health surveys. Katie Liston, a key researcher in sport and gender relations in Ireland, highlights that 'there seems to be an increasing diversity in the kinds of activities in which people participate in', and that there is a shift towards 'lifestyle' activities for adults as diversity increases in young people's participation in sports and leisure activities. Against the backdrop of Liston's work, this article delves deeper into data collected as part of a wider research project, discussing whether or not women who surf in Ireland do so as part of a process designed to construct and reflect their national identities related to this arguably 'postmodern' 'lifestyle sport', in which Ireland will be represented on the Olympic stage for the first time in 2021.",2021,"Telford, Rachael M.

International practice currently encourages integrated care for physical and mental health in oncology. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has affected the delivery of healthcare services across the world. The current research paper is on the psycho-oncology service provision for hospitalised cancer patients before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: All patients who were referred to psycho-oncology services during the study period of 1 month, in the two successive years of 2019 and 2020, were included in the study. Retrospective data were collected from the centralised electronic medical records for patients. Data included cancer diagnosis, reason for admission, admitting team and reason for a psychiatric referral. Other parameters that were measured were the timing of the psychiatric assessment, psychiatric diagnosis and psycho-oncology care provided, which included psychological interventions carried out and medications prescribed. The overall institutional data on cancer care provision are also presented in brief to provide context to the psycho-oncology services. RESULTS: Integrated psycho-oncology services reviewed and managed patients round the year in the hospital where the study was conducted. During the 1-month study period, in 2019 and 2020, the total number of hospitalised cancer patients managed by the services was 74 and 52, respectively. During the study period of 2020, 292 patients with cancer who were being treated in the hospital had tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) tested on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and 50 members of healthcare staff also tested positive. The most common diagnosis of patients was found to be stress-related adjustment disorder [16/74 (21.6%) in 2019 and 16/52 (30.8%) in 2020]. The paper discusses the common stressors voiced by the patients and their caregivers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Several challenges of providing psychological services were overcome by the team and the paper touches upon the common strategies that were used during the pandemic. Most patients did not need medications, but a significant minority did benefit from treatment with psychotropic medications. Simple psychological interventions such as sleep hygiene, supportive therapy sessions and psycho-education benefited many patients and were feasible even during the pandemic. CONCLUSION: The provision of psycho-oncology services to cancer patients and their caregivers was important before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.

kymztuey,,WHO,Manufacturing Considerations for the Development of Lipid Nanoparticles Using Microfluidics,,,,unk,"In the recent of years, the use of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for RNA delivery has gained considerable attention, with a large number in the clinical pipeline as vaccine candidates or to treat a wide range of diseases. Microfluidics offers considerable advantages for their manufacture due to its scalability, reproducibility and fast preparation. Thus, in this study, we have evaluated operating and formulation parameters to be considered when developing LNPs. Among them, the flow rate ratio (FRR) and the total flow rate (TFR) have been shown to significantly influence the physicochemical characteristics of the produced particles. In particular, increasing the TFR or increasing the FRR decreased the particle size. The amino lipid choice (cationic-DOTAP and DDAB; ionisable-MC3), buffer choice (citrate buffer pH 6 or TRIS pH 7.4) and type of nucleic acid payload (PolyA, ssDNA or mRNA) have also been shown to have an impact on the characteristics of these LNPs. LNPs were shown to have a high (>90%) loading in all cases and were below 100 nm with a low polydispersity index (&#8804;0.25). The results within this paper could be used as a guide for the development and scalable manufacture of LNP systems using microfluidics.",2020,"Roces, Carla B; Lou, Gustavo; Jain, Nikita; Abraham, Suraj; Thomas, Anitha; Halbert, Gavin W; Perrie, Yvonne",,,#937530,,,,,227035721.0

Here, we aimed to investigate the effects of combined therapy of Chinese and western medicine on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS A total of 60 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were enrolled. Both the ordinary and severely affected patients were randomly divided into Groups A-C each with 10 cases each. The patients in Group A-C received Western medicine, Western medicine + traditional Chinese medicine, and Western medicine + traditional Chinese medicine + high dose of vitamin C, respectively. The time of disease recovery, symptoms disappearance, chest CT improvement, and tongue amelioration was recorded. Leukocyte, neutrophil and lymphocyte were monitored, as well as C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), procalitonin (PCT), inflammatory factors, partial pressure of oxygen and carbon dioxide (PaCO2) and oxygenation index (PaO2). Urinary tract stones, liver function, and other side-effects such as gastrointestinal dysfunction were also investigated. RESULTS Traditional Chinese medicine enhanced the effect of Western medicine, including the reduction of CRP, ESR, PCT, and inflammatory factors, and the increase of leukocyte, neutrophil, and lymphocyte counts, and the improvement of respiratory rate, PaO2, PaCO2, and oxygenation index. Traditional Chinese medicine combined with high-dose Vitamin C therapy more effectively shortened the time of disease recovery, symptom disappearance, chest CT improvement, and tongue amelioration.

Although survival-related traits often trade off with reproduction, survival-related traits themselves may trade off with each other under energy limitation. Whole-organism performance and the immune system both enhance survival, yet are costly, but it is unclear how the two might trade off with each other under energy-limited conditions. Resources may be allocated to very different types of performance (e.g., aerobic endurance versus anaerobic sprinting) just as they may be allocated to different components of the immune system (e.g., innate versus acquired) to maximize survival. We forced allocation to different performance traits in green anole lizards (Anolis carolinensis), using specialized exercise training, to determine how different components of the immune system would be impacted by shifts in energy use. We measured immunocompetence in endurance trained, sprint trained, and untrained control lizards with the swelling response to phytohemagglutinin (cell-mediated), antibody response to sheep red blood cells (acquired humoral), and wound healing (integrated). Endurance-trained lizards had reduced cell-mediated immunity, whereas sprint-trained lizards had reduced rates of wound healing. The acquired immune response was not affected by either type of training. Because each immune measure responded differently to the different types of training, our results do not support the hypothesis that simple energy limitation determines overall investment in immunity.

We report on the impact on pediatric oncology care in Latin American (LATAM) during its first year. METHOD Four cross-sectional surveys were electronically distributed among pediatric onco-hematologists in April/June/October 2020, and April/2021 through the Latin American Society of Pediatric Oncology (SLAOP) email list and St Jude Global regional partners. RESULTS Four hundred fifty-three pediatric onco-hematologists from 20 countries responded to the first survey, with subsequent surveys response rates above 85%. More than 95% of participants reported that treatment continued without interruption for new and active ongoing patients, though with disruptions in treatment availability. During the first three surveys, respondents reported suspensions of outpatient procedures (54.2%), a decrease in oncologic surgeries (43.6%), radiotherapy (28.4%), stem cell transplants (SCT) (69.3%), and surveillance consultations (81.2%). Logistic regression analysis showed that at the beginning of the first wave, participants from countries with healthcare expenditure below 7% were more likely to report a decrease in outpatient procedures (odds ratio [OR]: 1.84, 95% CI: 1.19-2.8), surgeries (OR: 3, 95% CI: 1.9-4.6) and radiotherapy (OR: 6, 95% CI: 3.5-10.4). Suspension of surveillance consultations was higher in countries with COVID-19 case fatality rates above 2% (OR: 3, 95% CI: 1.4-6.2) and SCT suspensions in countries with COVID-19 incidence rate above 100 cases per 100,000 (OR: 3.48, 95% CI: 1.6-7.45). Paradoxically, at the beginning of the second wave with COVID-19 cases rising exponentially, most participants reported improvements in cancer services availability.

Procoagulant states are commonly found in association with the finding of antiphospholipid antibodies. The correlation of the latter with thrombosis and/or clinical severity remains controversial. Although measures of antiphospholipid antibodies most commonly include assessments for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, and anti-ß2-glycoprotein-I antibodies, lesser common antibodies have been detected, and there remains speculation that other yet undiscovered autoimmune thrombotic events may yet be found. The recent discovery of post-vaccination thromboses associated with platelet factor 4 antibody has created another level of concern. The pathogenesis of antiphospholipid antibodies and their role in COVID-19-related thrombosis deserves further attention.

The birth of a newborn baby is normally considered a joyful event, inhibiting mothers from expressing their depressive feelings. If the condition is not well understood and managed, mothers with postpartum depression are likely to experience suicidal ideation or even commit suicide. This study explored lived experiences of women who had recovered from a clinical diagnosis of postpartum depression in southwestern Uganda. METHODS: This phenomenological study adopted the explorative approach through in-depth interviews as guided by the biopsychosocial model of depression. It was conducted in Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital, Bwizibwera Health Centre IV and Kinoni Health Centre IV located in Mbarara and Rwampara districts, southwestern Uganda. Data were collected from 30 postpartum mothers who were purposively selected, between 9th December 2019 and 25th September 2020. We analyzed this work using thematic data analysis and this was steered by the Colaizzi’s six-step phenomenological approach of inquiry. RESULTS: The findings were summarized into five major themes: 1) somatic experiences including insomnia and headache, breast pain, poor breast milk production, weight loss and lack of energy; 2) difficulties in home and family life including overwhelming domestic chores, lack of social support from other family members, fighting at home and financial constraints due to COVID-19 pandemic; 3) negative emotions including anger, self-blame, despondency and feelings of loneliness and regrets of conceiving or marriage; 4) feelings of suicide, homicide and self-harm including suicidal ideation and attempt, homicidal ideations and attempt and feelings of self-harm and 5) coping with postpartum depression including spirituality, termination of or attempt to leave their marital relationships, acceptance, counselling and seeking medical treatment, perseverance. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Suicidal and homicidal thoughts are important parts of the postpartum depression experience, and these may put the lives of the mothers, their spouses and their babies at a great risk. Poor relationship quality, intimate partner violence and lack of financial resources contribute significantly to the negative emotional experiences of mothers with PPD.

More than 1.21 million cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection and more than 67,000 COVID-19-associated mortalities have been reported worldwide till the writing of this article, and these numbers are increasing every passing hour. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the SARS-CoV-2 spread as a global public health emergency and admitted COVID-19 as a pandemic now. Multiple sequence alignment data correlated with the already published reports on SARS-CoV-2 evolution indicated that this virus is closely related to the bat severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronavirus (bat SARS-like CoV) and the well-studied human SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The disordered regions in viral proteins are associated with the viral infectivity and pathogenicity. Therefore, in this study, we have exploited a set of complementary computational approaches to examine the dark proteomes of SARS-CoV-2, bat SARS-like, and human SARS CoVs by analysing the prevalence of intrinsic disorder in their proteins. According to our findings, SARS-CoV-2 proteome contains very significant levels of structural order. In fact, except for nucleocapsid, Nsp8, and ORF6, the vast majority of SARS-CoV-2 proteins are mostly ordered proteins containing less intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDPRs). However, IDPRs found in SARS-CoV-2 proteins are functionally important. For example, cleavage sites in its replicase 1ab polyprotein are found to be highly disordered, and almost all SARS-CoV-2 proteins contains molecular recognition features (MoRFs), which are intrinsic disorder-based protein-protein interaction sites that are commonly utilized by proteins for interaction with specific partners.

RESULTS: Univariate and multivariable analyses revealed that depression symptom severity was significantly associated with the severity of cognitive impairment among patients with PASC. This association was driven primarily by lower performance on verbal fluency, attention, and delayed recall tasks among patients with higher depression symptoms severity. Perceived sleep concerns were an important predictor of self-reported memory disturbances.

Although the underlying events leading to this blood-clotting phenomenon has yet to be elucidated, several critical observations present a compelling potential mechanism. Thrombus formation requires the von Willebrand (VWF) protein to be in ultra-large multimeric state. The conservation of this state is controlled by the ADAMTS13 enzyme, whose proteolytic activity reduces the size of VWF multimers, keeping blood clotting at bay. However, ADAMTS13 cannot act on VWF that is bound to platelet factor 4 (PF4). As such, it is of particular interest to note that a common feature between subjects presenting with VITT is high titres of antibodies against PF4. This raises the possibility that these antibodies preserve the stability of ultra-large VWF complexes, leading to the formation of endothelium-anchored VWF strings, which are capable of recruiting circulating platelets and causing uncontrolled thrombosis in terminal capillaries.

As most droplets in a common situation are immersed in external flows (such as ambient flows), we consider the effect of canonical flow profiles namely, shear flow, Poiseuille flow, and unsteady shear flow on the transport of spherical droplets of radius ranging from 5$μ$m to 100 $μ$m, which are characteristic lengths in human talking, coughing or sneezing processes. The dynamics we employ satisfies the Maxey-Riley (M-R) equation. An order-of-magnitude estimate allows us to solve the M-R equation to leading order analytically, and to higher order (accounting for the Boussinesq-Basset memory term) numerically. Discarding evaporation, our results to leading order indicate that the maximum travelled distance for small droplets ($5μm$ radius) under a shear/Poiseuille external flow with a maximum flow speed of $1m/s$ may easily reach more than 250 meters, since those droplets remain in the air for around 600 seconds. The maximum travelled distance was also calculated to leading and higher orders, and it is observed that there is a small difference between the leading and higher order results, and that it depends on the strength of the flow. For example, this difference for droplets of radius $5μm$ in a shear flow, and with a maximum wind speed of $5m/s$, is seen to be around $2m$. In general, higher order terms are observed to slightly enhance droplets' dispersion and their flying time.",2021,"Sandoval, Mario Vergara Omar",,,#ppcovidwho-320692,,,,,231933863.0
lz8zo5k4,,WHO,Detection and analysis of clinical features of patients with different COVID-19 types,,,,unk,"OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to investigate the change of various indexes in patients with different types of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: 75 COVID-19 patients were collected from the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, and they were classified into moderate, severe and critically severe types according to the disease severity. The basic information, blood routine, pneumonia-related blood indexes, immune-related indexes along with liver, kidney and myocardial indexes in patients with different types were analyzed. RESULTS: The analysis of immune-related indexes showed that the proportions of critically severe patients with abnormal IL-2 and IL-4 were higher than those of severe and moderate patients. In addition, the proportion of patients with abnormal total cholesterol increased as the severity of disease increased, and the proportion in critically severe patients was significantly higher than that in moderate patients. CONCLUSIONS: The patients with a more severe COVID-19 are older and more likely to have a history of hypertension. With the progression of COVID-19, the abnormal proportion of total white blood cell, neutrophils, lymphocytes, IL-2, IL-4 and total cholesterol increased. The change of these indexes in patients with different COVID-19 types could provide reference for the disease severity identification and diagnosis of COVID-19. In addition, the change in the total cholesterol level suggested that COVID-19 would induce some liver function damage in patients. This article is protected by copyright.

Resveratrol is commercially available polyphenol that exerts beneficial effects in wide array of cardiovascular diseases including cardiac hypertrophy, myocardial infarction and heart failure. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms responsible for these effects are not fully elucidated. Since resveratrol is a well-known CYP1B1 inhibitor, the purpose of this study is to test whether resveratrol attenuates angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced cellular hypertrophy through inhibition of CYP1B1/mid-chain HETEs mechanism. RL-14 and H9c2 cells were treated with vehicle or 10 μM Ang II in the absence and presence of 2, 10 or 50 μM resveratrol for 24 h. Thereafter, the level of mid-chain HETEs was determined using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC/MS). Hypertrophic markers and CYP1B1 gene expression and protein levels were measured using real-time PCR and Western blot analysis, respectively. Our results demonstrated that resveratrol, at concentrations of 10 and 50 μM, was able to attenuate Ang-II-induced cellular hypertrophy as evidenced by substantial inhibition of hypertrophic markers, β-myosin heavy chain (MHC)/α-MHC and atrial natriuretic peptide. Ang II significantly induced the protein expression of CYP1B1 and increased the metabolite formation rate of its associated mid-chain HETEs. Interestingly, the protective effect of resveratrol was associated with a significant decrease of CYP1B1 protein expression and mid-chain HETEs. Our results provided the first evidence that resveratrol protects against Ang II-induced cellular hypertrophy, at least in part, through CYP1B1/mid-chain HETEs-dependent mechanism.",2020-06-12,"Shoieb, Sherif M.; El-Kadi, Ayman O.

The efficacy of the tonic was evaluated and expressed as cell proliferation rate and plaque reduction rate in Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells, against 3 strains of influenza A and B viruses. This boiling water (at 100°C) extract of Isatidis Radix (RIE) showed antiviral activity against influenza virus A and B. The concentration for 50% inhibition of influenza virus A replication (IC50) in MDCK cell was 12.6mg/mL with a therapeutic index >8. When cells were incubated with RIE prior to virus adsorption, the numbers of viable cell were at least doubled compared to the numbers of virus control, RIE incubation after virus adsorption and RIE incubation with virus prior to adsorption, in both influenza virus A and B. Moreover, much less virus particles were spotted by scanning electron microscope (SEM) in the RIE pre-treated cells than the cells without RIE treatment. These results indicate the antiviral activity of RIE is mainly attributed to its host cell protection effect but not actions on virus or post-virus-adsorption interruption.

Studies have shown that patients with COVID-19 are prone to thrombotic disease resulting in increased mortality. We present a case of COVID-19 pneumonia in a warehouse worker with a giant thrombus-in-transit involving the right ventricle and tricuspid valve. We also describe the associated diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. CASE REPORT A 54-year-old man with recent COVID-19 exposure presented with fever, cough, dyspnea, and syncope and was found to be in hypoxic respiratory failure requiring supplemental oxygen. The clinical course deteriorated with worsening respiratory failure and septic shock, requiring mechanical ventilation and pressor support. Further evaluation revealed a positive nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 and an S1Q3T3 pattern on electrocardiogram. A bedside transthoracic echocardiogram was performed due to clinical deterioration and hemodynamic instability, which showed a large thrombus-in-transit through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle. The patient was treated with low-molecular-weight heparin, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and supportive care. A repeat echocardiogram after 1 week did not show any thrombus. The patient slowly improved over the following weeks but required tracheostomy due to prolonged mechanical ventilation. He was discharged on oral anticoagulation. CONCLUSIONS This case highlights the presence of significant COVID-19-related hemostatic disturbances and the importance of associated diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. A bedside echocardiogram can provide valuable information in patients with suspected high-risk pulmonary embolism and hemodynamic instability.

znxqdt8t,,WHO,"Who is dying from COVID-19 and when? An Analysis of fatalities in Tamil Nadu, India",,,,unk,"Background: As the number of COVID-19 cases continues to rise, public health efforts must focus on preventing avoidable fatalities. Understanding the demographic and clinical characteristics of deceased COVID-19 patients; and estimation of time-interval between symptom onset, hospital admission and death could inform public health interventions focusing on preventing mortality due to COVID-19. Methods: We obtained COVID-19 death summaries from the official dashboard of the Government of Tamil Nadu, between 10th May and July 10, 2020. Of the 1783 deaths, we included 1761 cases for analysis. Results: The mean age of the deceased was 62.5 years (SD: 13.7). The crude death rate was 2.44 per 100,000 population; the age-specific death rate was 22.72 among above 75 years and 0.02 among less than 14 years, and it was higher among men (3.5 vs 1.4 per 100,000 population). Around 85% reported having any one or more comorbidities; Diabetes (62%), hypertension (49.2%) and CAD (17.5%) were the commonly reported comorbidities. The median time interval between symptom onset and hospital admission was 4 days (IQR: 2, 7); admission and death was 4 days (IQR: 2, 7) with a significant difference between the type of admitting hospital. One-fourth of (24.2%) deaths occurred within a day of hospital admission. Conclusion: Elderly, male, people living in densely populated areas and people with underlying comorbidities die disproportionately due to COVID-19. While shorter time-interval between symptom onset and admission is essential, the relatively short time interval between admission and death is a concern and the possible reasons must be evaluated and addressed to reduce avoidable mortality.",2020,"Asirvatham, Edwin Sam; Sarman, Charishma Jones; Saravanamurthy, Sakthivel P; Mahalingam, Periasamy; Maduraipandian, Swarna; Lakshmanan, Jeyaseelan",,,#813505,,,,,222119101.0

2s0yz5ce,,WHO,Covalent and non-covalent binding free energy calculations for peptidomimetic inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 main protease,,,,unk,"COVID-19, the disease caused by the newly discovered coronavirus-SARS-CoV-2, has created a global health, social, and economic crisis. As of mid-January 2021, there are over 90 million confirmed cases and more than 2 million reported deaths due to COVID-19. Currently, there are very limited therapeutics for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19. For this reason, it is important to find drug targets that will lead to the development of safe and effective therapeutics against the disease. The main protease (Mpro) of the virus is an attractive target for the development of effective antiviral therapeutics because it is required for proteolytic cleavage of viral polyproteins. Furthermore, the Mpro has no human homologues, so drugs designed to bind to this target directly have less risk for off-target effects. Recently, several high-resolution crystallographic structures of the Mpro in complex with inhibitors have been determined-to guide drug development and to spur efforts in structure-based drug design. One of the primary objectives of modern structure-based drug design is the accurate prediction of receptor-ligand binding affinities for rational drug design and discovery. Here, we perform rigorous alchemical absolute binding free energy calculations and QM/MM calculations to give insight into the total binding energy of two recently crystallized inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, namely, N3 and &#945;-ketoamide 13b. The total binding energy consists of both covalent and non-covalent binding components since both compounds are covalent inhibitors of the Mpro. Our results indicate that the covalent and non-covalent binding free energy contributions of both inhibitors to the Mpro target differ significantly. The N3 inhibitor has more favourable non-covalent interactions, particularly hydrogen bonding, in the binding site of the Mpro than the &#945;-ketoamide inhibitor. Also, the Gibbs energy of reaction for the Mpro-N3 covalent adduct is greater than the Gibbs reaction energy for the Mpro-&#945;-ketoamide covalent adduct. These differences in the covalent and non-covalent binding free energy contributions for both inhibitors could be a plausible explanation for their in vitro differences in antiviral activity. Our findings are consistent with the reversible and irreversible character of both inhibitors as reported by experiment and highlight the importance of both covalent and non-covalent binding free energy contributions to the absolute binding affinity of a covalent inhibitor towards its target. This information could prove useful in the rational design, discovery, and evaluation of potent SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors for targeted antiviral therapy.",2021,"Awoonor-Williams, Ernest; Abu-Saleh, Abd Al-Aziz A",Phys Chem Chem Phys,,#covidwho-1132112,,,,,232217261.0

Meningitis, encephalitis, and hepatic dysfunction have also been reported, particularly in severe cases with multisystem involvement. Scrub typhus has never been reported in the literature to cause urinary tract infections (UTIs) which includes cystitis and pyelonephritis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 45-year old male presenting to the outpatient unit with fever, right flank pain, and burning micturition for three days was initially treated for UTI. However, he returned to the hospital on the fourth day of illness with persistent symptoms. He was hospitalized, with intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone. Computerized tomography scan of his abdomen-pelvis showed features of acute pyelonephritis, so his antibiotics were upgraded to meropenem and teicoplanin. Despite this, the patient’s condition deteriorated. Laboratory investigations showed multisystem involvement: decreasing platelets, raised creatinine, and deranged liver panel. As Kathmandu was hit by dengue epidemic during the patient’s hospitalization, on the seventh day of his illness, blood samples were sent for tropical fever investigation. All tests came out negative except for scrub typhus—IgM antibodies positive on rapid diagnostic test. The patient’s symptoms subsided after 48 h of starting doxycycline and he became fully asymptomatic four days later. Fever did not recur even after discontinuing other IV antibiotics, favoring scrub typhus disease rather than systemic bacterial sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: Scrub typhus is an emerging infectious disease of Nepal. Therefore, every unexplained fever cases (irrespective of clinical presentation) should be evaluated for potential Rickettsiosis. Moreover, for cases with acute pyelonephritis, atypical causative agents should be investigated, for example scrub typhus in this case.",2020-05-06,"Bhattarai, Tulsi; Poudel, Sujan Chandra; Pokharel, Nishma; Bhattarai, Suraj",BMC Infect Dis,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/9817181e3f1c7e2f11e4efc1e7add7a9b35653cf.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7201669.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7201669/,

This study described an economical and effective population-based screening pipeline and performed the project of a million scale children and adolescents myopia survey (CAMS), which will shed light on the further study of myopia from the level of epidemiology and precision medicine. METHODS: We developed a novel population-based screening pattern, an intelligent screening process and internet-based information transmission and analysis system to carry out the survey consisting of school children in Wenzhou, China. The examination items include unaided distance visual acuity, presenting distance visual acuity, and non-cycloplegic autorefraction. Myopia and high myopia were defined as spherical equivalent (SE) ≤ − 1.00 diopters (D) and SE ≤ − 6.00 D, respectively. Next, the reports of the vision checking were automatically sent to parents and the related departments. The CAMS project will be done two to four times annually with the support of the government. An online eyesight status information management system (OESIMS) was developed to construct comprehensive and efficient electronic vision health records (EVHRs) for myopia information inquiry, risk pre-warning, and further study. RESULTS: The CAMS completed the first-round of screening within 30 days for 99.41% of Wenzhou students from districts and counties, in June 2019. A total of 1,060,925 participants were eligible for CAMS and 1,054,251 (99.37% participation rate) were selected through data quality control, which comprised 1305 schools, and 580,609, 251,050 and 170,967 elementary, middle, and high school students. The mean age of participants was 12.21 ± 3.32 years (6–20 years), the female-to-male ratio was 0.82. The prevalence of myopia in elementary, middle, and high school students was 38.16%, 77.52%, and 84.00%, respectively, and the high myopia incidence was 0.95%, 6.90%, and 12.98%. CONCLUSIONS: The CAMS standardized myopia screening model involves automating large-scale information collection, data transmission, data analysis and early warning, thereby supporting myopia prevention and control. The entire survey reduced 90% of staff, cost, and time consumption compared with previous surveys. This will provide new insights for decision support for public health intervention.

The causative agent is a novel coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is similar to SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Adult infection with respiratory symptoms was considered in the beginning of the pandemic. Now, it has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 infects children and other organs such as the gastrointestinal tract. SARS-CoV-2 enters the host cells through angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptors as the main receptor expressed in various organs such as the lungs and gastrointestinal tract. Studies on children and the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 do not completely explain the natural course of infection in children, and precisely how the GI tract is involved is not understood. The present article highlights the gastrointestinal manifestations and pathological findings in children with COVID-19. According to the evidence, SARS-CoV-2 infection is milder in children and may present different clinical symptoms from adults. Common clinical manifestations of pediatric COVID-19 include cough, fever, sore throat, malaise, fatigue, and GI symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Furthermore, liver and pancreatic enzymes may be elevated during the pediatric COVID-19 course. Asymptomatic children carriers are potential sources of infection for adults, especially elderly ones.

The absence of the dystrophin protein leads to a complex cascade of pathogenic events in myofibres, including chronic inflammation and oxidative stress as well as altered metabolism. The attention towards dietary supplements in DMD is rapidly increasing, with the aim to counteract pathology-related alteration in nutrient intake, the consequences of catabolic distress or to enhance the immunological response of patients as nowadays for the COVID-19 pandemic emergency. By definition, supplements do not exert therapeutic actions, although a great confusion may arise in daily life by the improper distinction between supplements and therapeutic compounds. For most supplements, little research has been done and little evidence is available concerning their effects in DMD as well as their preventing actions against infections. Often these are not prescribed by clinicians and patients/caregivers do not discuss the use with their clinical team. Then, little is known about the real extent of supplement use in DMD patients. It is mistakenly assumed that, since compounds are of natural origin, if a supplement is not effective, it will also do no harm. However, supplements can have serious side effects and also have harmful interactions, in terms of reducing efficacy or leading to toxicity, with other therapies. It is therefore pivotal to shed light on this unclear scenario for the sake of patients. This review discusses the supplements mostly used by DMD patients, focusing on their potential toxicity, due to a variety of mechanisms including pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic interactions and contaminations, as well as on reports of adverse events.

Screening has an essential role in preventive medicine. Ideally, screening tools detect patients early enough to manage the disease and reduce symptoms. We aimed to determine the cost-effectiveness of routine screening schedules. Methods. We used a discrete-time nonstationary Markov model to simulate the progression of depression. We adopted annual transition probabilities, which were dependent on patient histories, such as the number of previous episodes, treatment status, and time spent without treatment state based on the available data. We used Monte Carlo techniques to simulate the stochastic model for 20 years or during the lifetime of individuals. Baseline and screening scenario models with screening frequencies of annual, 2-year, and 5-year were compared based on incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER). Results. In the general population, all screening strategies were cost-effective compared to the baseline. However, male and female populations differed based on cost over quality-adjusted life years (QALY). Females had lower ICERs, and annual screening had the highest ICER for females, with 11,134 $/QALY gained. In contrast, males had around three times higher ICER, with annual screening costs of 34,065$/QALY gained. Conclusions. Considering the high lifetime prevalence and recurrence rates of depression, detection and prevention efforts can be one critical cornerstone to support required care.

Although vaccine research and development technology has made great progress, the possibility of obtaining a safe and effective vaccine that can control the global epidemic in a short period of time is still low due to the antibody-dependent enhancement effect (ADE) of the vaccine and the mutation of the virus. In the absence of specific treatment for COVID-19, finding other alternative protection schemes has become another treatment idea. Epidemiological studies have found that, in this COVID-19 epidemic, countries with long-term Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination policies have relatively less cases and lower mortality rates than countries without relevant policies. This phenomenon may be related to the ""training immunity"" effect of BCG. In order to further clarify the preventive and protective effects of BCG vaccine on SARS-CoV-2 infection, a number of clinical trials are underway.",2020-11-01,"Huang, Wenmian; Liu, Tao; Feng, Guodong; Wang, Xin",Xi bao yu fen zi mian yi xue za zhi = Chinese journal of cellular and molecular immunology,,,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33210600/,227063095.0

Drug discovery, as an example, requires that researchers efficiently winnow thousands of potential targets to a small candidate set for more thorough evaluation. However, research groups spend significant time and money to perform the experiments necessary to determine this candidate set long before seeing intermediate results. Hypothesis generation systems address this challenge by mining the wealth of publicly available scientific information to predict plausible research directions. We present AGATHA, a deep-learning hypothesis generation system that can introduce data-driven insights earlier in the discovery process. Through a learned ranking criteria, this system quickly prioritizes plausible term-pairs among entity sets, allowing us to recommend new research directions. We massively validate our system with a temporal holdout wherein we predict connections first introduced after 2015 using data published beforehand. We additionally explore biomedical sub-domains, and demonstrate AGATHA's predictive capacity across the twenty most popular relationship types. This system achieves best-in-class performance on an established benchmark, and demonstrates high recommendation scores across subdomains.

There is an increasing interest in the application of the photocatalytic properties of TiO(2) for disinfection of surfaces, air and water. Reviews of the applications of photocatalysis in disinfection (Gamage and Zhang 2010; Chong et al., Wat Res 44(10):2997–3027, 2010) and of modelling of TiO(2) action have recently been published (Dalrymple et al. , Appl Catal B 98(1–2):27–38, 2010). In this review, we give an overview of the effects of photoactivated TiO(2) on microorganisms. The activity has been shown to be capable of killing a wide range of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, filamentous and unicellular fungi, algae, protozoa, mammalian viruses and bacteriophage. Resting stages, particularly bacterial endospores, fungal spores and protozoan cysts, are generally more resistant than the vegetative forms, possibly due to the increased cell wall thickness. The killing mechanism involves degradation of the cell wall and cytoplasmic membrane due to the production of reactive oxygen species such as hydroxyl radicals and hydrogen peroxide. This initially leads to leakage of cellular contents then cell lysis and may be followed by complete mineralisation of the organism. Killing is most efficient when there is close contact between the organisms and the TiO(2) catalyst.

Despite increasing enthusiasm for IPP/IPA LARC insertion, adolescents' preferences and experiences have seldom been examined. The objective of this review was to examine the attitudes of adolescents (aged 10-19 years) towards IPP/IPA LARC, their experiences and perceptions around having a LARC device fitted IPP/IPA and the factors involved in decision-making to use, not use or discontinue IPP/IPA LARC. MATERIAL AND METHODS In January 2021 we searched seven bibliographic databases for original research articles published in English, from the year 2000. Studies of any design focussed on IPP/IPA LARC were eligible for inclusion. Three of the authors assessed articles for eligibility and extracted data relevant to the outcomes of the review. Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tools were used to assess methodological quality. Key themes emerging from the data were synthesised and reported narratively. RESULTS We identified 10 relevant articles, four of which were entirely adolescent-focused. Only three addressed IPA LARC. IPP availability was important for ensuring access to LARC postpartum. Attitudes towards LARC IPP were associated with adolescents' sociodemographic characteristics and positive perceptions related to the long duration of action. Determinants of discontinuation and non-use included poor-quality contraceptive counseling, intolerable side-effects and subsequent distress, misconceptions about LARC safety IPP and the influence of partners and community on autonomy. No factors involved in IPA LARC decision-making were available. Limited evidence demonstrated that adolescents may favour contraceptive implants over intrauterine devices, and in certain contexts may face greater barriers to IPA LARC access than adult women. CONCLUSIONS Immediate insertion of LARC postpartum appears acceptable to adolescents who do not experience side-effects and those with the opportunity to make autonomous contraception decisions. This important topic has been addressed in few studies involving an entirely adolescent population. Very limited evidence is available on IPA LARC. Further research on adolescents' lived experiences of IPP/IPA LARC access and use is necessary to inform the provision of person-centred care when assisting adolescents' contraceptive choice following pregnancy.",2021-02-20,"Buckingham, Pip; Moulton, Jessica E; Subasinghe, Asvini K; Amos, Natalie; Mazza, Danielle",Acta obstetricia et gynecologica Scandinavica,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1111/aogs.14129; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33608901/,231970850.0

We previously identified extracellular nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (eNAMPT) as a novel damage-associated molecular pattern protein (DAMP) via TLR4 ligation which regulates inflammatory cascade activation. eNAMPT is tightly linked to human ARDS by biomarker and genotyping studies in ARDS subjects. We now hypothesize that an eNAMPT-neutralizing mAb will significantly reduce the severity of ARDS lung inflammatory lung injury in diverse preclinical rat and porcine models. Sprague Dawley rats received eNAMPT mAb intravenously following exposure to intratracheal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or to a traumatic blast (125 kPa) but prior to initiation of ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) (4 h). Yucatan minipigs received intravenous eNAMPT mAb 2 h after initiation of septic shock and VILI (12 h). Each rat/porcine ARDS/VILI model was strongly associated with evidence of severe inflammatory lung injury with NFkB pathway activation and marked dysregulation of the Akt/mTORC2 signaling pathway. eNAMPT neutralization dramatically reduced inflammatory indices and the severity of lung injury in each rat/porcine ARDS/VILI model (~ 50% reduction) including reduction in serum lactate, and plasma levels of eNAMPT, IL-6, TNFα and Ang-2. The eNAMPT mAb further rectified NFkB pathway activation and preserved the Akt/mTORC2 signaling pathway.

We evaluate the efficacy of PTI in improving venepuncture success rate (SR) for patients with poor venous access. METHODS This prospective randomized controlled trial looked at adult patients (n = 69) aged 21-90 with difficult venous access (history of ≥3 consecutive attempts required for successful cannulation during the current admission) requiring non-emergent venepuncture. Patients underwent venepuncture over the upper-limb using one of the following: conventional venepuncture (control); Veinlite® EMS (TransLite®, Texas, USA), a commercial transillumination device; PTI. Outcome measures were: successful cannulation within 2 attempts and total duration of venepuncture. Fisher's exact and Kruskal-Wallis tests were performed. RESULTS A significantly larger number of patients had successful venepuncture within 2 attempts using PTI (22/23, 95.7%) and Veinlite (23/23, 100%), compared to the controls (7/23, 30.4%) (p < 0.05). The total duration required for successful venepuncture was significantly shorter for Veinlite (mean 3.7 min, 1.0-5.3 min) and PTI (mean 8.5 min, range 1.08-27 min) compared to the controls (mean 23.2 min, range 1.88-46.5 min) (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS PTI allows users to visualize veins invisible to the naked eye. Thrombosed/tortuous veins, branch points and valves, are easily identified and avoided.

Similarly, physical conditions of the built environment (e.g., increased housing vacancies and increased travel costs) are significantly associated with increased reported mental health disorders. However, this positive relationship between the physical conditions of the built environment and mental health outcomes does not hold across all the metropolitan areas, suggesting a mixed effect of the built environment’s physical conditions on community mental health.

This article searched and selected the relevant cross-sectional surveys from PubMed, Embase, VIP, CNKI, Wanfang, and CBM databases according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria and used the STROBE list combined with the observational research quality evaluation tools of Sanderson to conduct the quality appraisal. The “meta” and “metaphor” packages of the R software version 3.5.1 were used for the meta-analysis. A total of 17 studies with 2697 patients were included. The total scores of the social support and objective support of the renal transplant patients were abundant after the operation, indicating that the economic, physical, and emotional supports from the family, society, and the official organization are accepted. But the subjective support and support utilization degree were general. The support utilization was different among different genders, and female patients were lower than the males. In particular, the female patients relatively presented autism and the social support utilization degree was low.

This study aimed to explore the experience of carers of people diagnosed with dementia during or following a hospital admission in order to identify factors that had prevented them from seeking help beforehand. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 informal carers including adults caring for a parent, a friend or a spouse diagnosed with dementia between 2010-2019, following an acute hospital admission for a physical health problem, having not sought help previously. MAIN FINDINGS Carers created a 'bubble of normalisation' around themselves and the person living with dementia (PLWD) to reject the label of dementia and protect the PLWD from a loss of independence, discrimination and prejudice they felt would be the result of a diagnosis. Carers struggled to talk to the PLWD about dementia reinforcing denial and stigma. Post-diagnosis carers felt unsupported and questioned the value of diagnosis. PRINCIPAL CONCLUSIONS Stigma related to images of dementia as a disease that takes away independence and identity prevented discussion about dementia between carers and the PLWD.

SLCs also are present in the adult testis. Their identification, characteristics, and regulation in the adult testis remain uncertain. Using single-cell RNA-seq, we found that the mesenchymal stromal population may be involved in ALC regeneration. Upon ALC elimination, a fraction of stromal cells begins to proliferate while a different fraction begins to differentiate to ALCs. Transcriptomic analysis identified five stromal clusters that can be classified into two major groups representing proliferation and differentiation populations. The proliferating group represents stem cells expressing high levels of CD90, Nes, Lum, Fn and Gap43. The differentiating group represents a progenitor stage that is ready to form ALCs, and specifically expresses Vtn, Rasl11a, Id1 and Egr2. The observation that the actively dividing cells after ALC loss were not those that formed ALCs suggests that stem cell proliferation and differentiation are regulated separately, and that the maintenance of the stromal stem cell pool occurs at the population level. The study also identified specific markers for the major interstitial cell groups and potential paracrine factors involved in the regulation of SLCs.

This potential, combined with its general pathological impact, raises the question if syphilis increases mortality in oral cancer patients. The aim of the study was to assess if the five-year survival rates among patients suffering from oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) with (cohort I) and without association with syphilis (cohort II) differ. METHODS: Retrospective clinical data of patients diagnosed with OSCC (International Classification of Diseases [ICD]-10 codes C01–06) within the past 20 years from the access date September 25, 2021 were retrieved from the TriNetX network (TriNetX, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA) to gain initial cohort 0. Subjects also diagnosed with syphilis (ICD-10 codes A51–53) were assigned to cohort I. Cohort II was comprised of the remaining individuals of cohort 0 by creating a group with the same number of patients as cohort I, and by matching for age and gender. Subsequently, Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression were performed, and risk, odds and hazard ratios were calculated. RESULTS: Of a total of 73,736 patients in cohort 0, 199 individuals were each assigned to cohort I and II. During the five-year period after tumor diagnosis, 39 and 30 patients in cohort I and II died. The five-year survival probabilities did not significantly differ between the cohorts (I vs. II = 74.19% vs. 75.01%; p = 0.52; Log-Rank test), nor the risk of dying (I vs. II = 19.6% vs. 15.08%; risk difference = 4.52%; p = 0.23). The calculated risk, odds and hazard ratios were 1.3 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.84; 2.00), 1.37 (95% CI = 0.81; 2.31) and 1.17 (95% CI = 0.73; 1.88), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The obtained results indicate that the survival rate of individuals with OSCC might not be negatively influenced if syphilis is present/associated. However, the results need to be interpreted cautiously due to limitations related to the retrospective approach, especially as data on the tumor staging were not accessible.

As a part of the new curriculum by the National Medical Council of India, we introduced certain teaching and assessment modifications in anatomy. There are few studies on the actual implementation of CBME. The current study aimed to assess the perceived usefulness of the teaching, learning, and assessment methodology (TLAM) based on written feedback from students. METHODS: All the 147 first MBBS students of the batch who had undergone the new teaching learning methodology answered the questionnaire on usefulness of the various TLAMs on a 3-point Likert scale which was taken as quantitative data. They were also asked to pen down their opinions and suggestions about the TLAM which was thematically analysed and considered as qualitative data. Face and content validity was assessed prior to administration of the questionnaire. Descriptive statistics were used for quantitative variables. Qualitative data were analysed by thematic analysis. RESULTS: 100% of the students found vertical integration and small group teaching as useful. Seminars and quizzes were reported as useful to extremely useful by 75.5% of the students. Self-directed learning and near-peer teaching was also appreciated well by 78% of students. In Embryology and Neuroanatomy, these active learning methods were not found to be useful as these topics were difficult to understand. Overall, the new TLAM introduced as per the new medical curriculum was found useful for the majority of students. CONCLUSION: This study provides valuable insights on the teaching, learning, and assessment methods as formulated by the competency-based medical curriculum.

However, there have been limited efforts to discover the size of the gaps in the seal required to compromise filtering facepiece respirator performance, with prior studies estimating this size based on in vitro models. In this study, we measure the size of leak necessary to compromise the fit of N95 respirators. METHODS: Two methods were used to create a gap of specific dimensions. A set of 3D-printed resin spacers and hollow steel rods were used to generate gaps in N95 respirators while worn on 2 participants. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) quantitative fit testing methods were used to quantify mask performance with gaps between 0.4 and 2.9-mm diameters. RESULTS: Gap size was regressed against fit factor, showing that overall, the minimum gap size to compromise N95 performance was between 1.5 mm(2) and 3 mm(2).

The potential of these nanocarriers lies in their ability to improve the gastrointestinal stability, solubility and permeability of their cargo drugs. However, achieving efficient oral drug delivery through lipid-based nanocarriers is a challenging task, since they encounter multiple physicochemical barriers along the gastrointestinal tract, e.g. the gastric acidic content, the intestinal mucus layer or the enzymatic degradation, that they must surmount to reach their target. These limitations may be turned into opportunities through a rational design of lipid-based nanocarriers. For that purpose, this review focuses on the main challenges of the oral route indicating the strategies undertaken for lipid-based nanocarriers in order to overcome them.

Lasting effects and long-term sequalae could persist after the infection and may be due to persistent endothelial dysfunction. Purpose Our study focused on the study of endothelial function measurement by digital thermal monitoring (DTM) of endothelial quality index with E4 diagnosis Polymath in a large cohort of long COVID-19 patients to determine whether long COVID-19 symptoms are due to endothelial dysfunction. Methods This is a prospective multicenter longitudinal observational cohort study. Endothelial function was evaluated with “E4-Diagnose” Polymath Tunisia based on the Endothelium Quality Index (EQI). A complete echocardiographic evaluation analysis was performed. Primary outcomes were defined as the occurrence of long COVID-19 symptoms in patients with endothelial dysfunction measured by EQI. Results A total of 798 patients were included in this study. Patients were included at an average time of 68.93±43.1days. The mean EQI was 2.02±0.99 [0–5]. A total of 397 (49.7%) patients had poor or very poor EQI and 211 (26.4%) patients had very poor EQI. The median age was 49.94±14.2 (18–80) years. A total of 618 patients (77.4%) had long COVID-19 symptoms. Patients with long COVID-19 symptoms had a reduced EQI (1.99±0.97 vs. 2.09±1.05, P =0.24). Among long COVID-19 symptoms, fatigue was the most common symptom reported in 42.2%. Fatigue and chest pain were significantly associated to the endothelial dysfunction (P =0.04 and 0.001 respectively). Patients with chest pain had significantly lower EQI (1.74±1.0 vs. 2.09±0.9, P ≤10−3) and LVGLS (−16.35±3.0 vs. −17.16±2.5, P =0.04).

It impairs the quality of life and reduces the ability to work and function, leading to increasing costs of sick leaves and disability pensions. Current treatment strategies focus on biological and psychological pathways while understating the role of lifestyle factors. Epidemiological studies have shown convincing evidence of an inverse relationship between diet quality and depression. However, only limited data are available on the therapeutic effects of diet quality improvement on depression. Using a randomized controlled trial design, our primary aim is to investigate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a behavioral nutrition group intervention compared to a social support intervention in the treatment of depression. METHODS: Participants (N=144, aged 20–65 years) with a diagnosis of moderate or severe depression recruited in collaboration with outpatient care units will be randomized into two arms: Food for Mind (FM) nutrition intervention (n=72) or Bring Good Mood (BGM) social support control group (n=72). Both arms will be provided with 6 group sessions over an 8-week period. FM involves improving diet quality by applying strength-based behavioral nutrition counseling and activities facilitated by a registered dietitian. The control arm comprises a befriending protocol. During the interventions, all participants will continue their treatment for depression as usual. Longitudinal data are collected at baseline, at 8 weeks, and at 6- and 12-month follow-ups. Depressive symptoms, diet quality, eating behavior, ability to work and function, and quality of life are assessed by self-reported questionnaires. A treatment expectancy questionnaire will be administered at baseline and an acceptability questionnaire at 8 weeks. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale is used as the primary endpoint at 1 year. The results will be analyzed with linear mixed-effects models. Economic evaluation includes both cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis. Two incremental cost-effectiveness ratios will be calculated to evaluate the incremental cost per QALY and the incremental cost per improvement in CES-D. DISCUSSION: If the intervention proves to be cost-effective and acceptable, it be can be implemented in healthcare to support the treatment of depression.

OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to assess the perception, knowledge, and application of the preventive measures taken by physiotherapists in managing issues with confirmed or suspected patients suffering from COVID-19. METHODS A self-administered survey comprising 15 questions was divided into four sections related to precautions when interacting with patients with COVID-19: (1) knowledge of the physiotherapy role, (2) knowledge of preventive measures to limit transmission of the virus, (3) practicing these measures, and (4) managing patients with COVID-19. RESULTS A total of 456 physiotherapists from 139 countries participated in the study. Most physiotherapists were knowledgeable regarding their role in the management of COVID-19 patients (M = 94.3%; SD = 15.4) and the management of potential COVID-19 patients (M = 84.5%; SD = 20.1). The rating of knowledge and practices of preventive measures to limit transmission of COVID-19 were lower (M = 74.3%; SD = 25.7, and M = 62.5%; SD = 31.3, respectively). Participants from the European region (M = 83; SD = 15.8) had a higher score than participants from the Asia Western Pacific region (M = 78; SD = 18.49; P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Physiotherapists are highly knowledgeable about their role in managing COVID-19 patients. Most of them are adopting preventive measures to limit the transmission of the disease.

Literature is beginning to suggest that these behaviours may be conducted automatically, although the instigation (deciding to do) and execution ('doing') of these behaviours has never been examined separately. The objective of this study was to test a theoretically informed supposition that oral hygiene behaviours in adults are automatic behaviours. METHODS One hundred and fifty participants attending three types of dental providers covering emergency and routine dental services, completed a questionnaire. The self-reported behavioural automaticity index scale (SRBAI) was used to measure behavioural automaticity. RESULTS Morning toothbrushing SRBAI scores were higher than evening scores (Z=-3.315, p = 0.001). Automaticity scores for instigating both toothbrushing and interdental cleaning were also higher compared to execution (toothbrushing: Z=-2.601, p = 0.009 and interdental cleaning: Z=-2.256. p = 0.024). Toothbrushing automaticity scores were associated with age, gender and self-efficacy, whereas interdental cleaning automaticity scores were associated with intention. Individuals in lower socio-economic status (SES) occupations had significantly higher automaticity scores for interdental cleaning compared to those with higher SES roles.

jacv2g0z,,WHO,Tuberculosis and COVID-19: An overlapping situation during pandemic,,,,unk,"INTRODUCTION: The novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). First COVID-19 case was detected in March, 10, 2020 in Turkey and as of May, 18, 2020 148,067 cases have been identified and 4096 citizens have died. Tuberculosis (TB) is a worldwide public health concern, incidence of tuberculosis (per 100,000 people) in Turkey was reported at 14, 1 in 2018. During pandemic COVID-19 was the main concern in every clinic and as we discuss here overlapping respiratory diseases may result in delaying of the diagnosis and treatment. METHODOLOGY: There were 4605 respiratory samples examined between March 23 and May 18 for COVID-19 and 185 samples for Mycobacterium tuberculosis in our laboratory. The Xpert Ultra assay was performed for the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis; SARS-CoV-2 RNA was determined by real-time PCR (RT-PCR) analysis in combined nasopharyngeal and deep oropharyngeal swabs of suspected cases of COVID-19. RESULTS: Both of SARS-CoV-2 and M. tuberculosis tests were requested on the clinical and radiological grounds in 30 patients. Here we discussed 2 patients who were both COVID-19 and TB positive. One patient already diagnosed with tuberculosis become COVID-19 positive during hospitalization and another patient suspected and treated for COVID-19 received the final diagnosis of pulmonary TB and Human Immunodeficiency Virus infection.

However, these studies comprised of an estimate rather than a broad analysis of exact numbers. In this study, we planned to investigate whether the pandemic really resulted in an increase in facial paralysis cases admitted to the hospital by evaluating the cases who applied to our hospital due to facial paralysis in the COVID-19 pandemic year and in the previous 4 years. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients who applied to our hospital due to facial paralysis between March 2016-February 2017 (Group 1), between March 2017-February 2018 (Group 2), between March 2018-February 2019 (Group 3), between March 2019-February 2020 (Group 4), and between March 2020-February 2021 (Group 5) were investigated and detailed data were noted. RESULTS: 156, 164, 149, 172 and 157 patients were admitted to the hospital due to peripheral facial paralysis in Group 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively. Of these patients, 155, 164, 145, 169, and 153 were Bell's palsy, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test was positive in only 2 of the 153 patients who were diagnosed in the year of the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the number of peripheral facial paralysis detected during the COVID-19 pandemic was similar to previous years.

We find that the high-risk regions are mainly distributed along the southern half of Beijing-Hong Kong HSR line, where a large number of infection cases have been confirmed at the early stage. Furthermore, the two components of the infection risk, namely, the probability (proxied by the region’s correlation with Wuhan through HSR) and the impact (proxied by the region’s population with mobility), can play different roles in the risk ranking for different regions. For public health administrators, these findings may be used for better decision making, including the preparation of emergency plans and supplies, and the allocation of limited resources, before the extensive spread of the epidemic.

METHODS: According to whether or not their glucose metabolism was impaired, COVID-19 patients were subdivided into 2 groups: 1) with DM and IFG, 2) control group. Their demographic data, medical history, signs and symptoms, laboratory results, and final clinical results were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: 28 patients (16.3%) died during hospitalization, including 21 (29.2%) in group 1 and 7 (7.0%) in group 2 (P < 0.001). Fbg levels in groups 1 and 2 were higher than the normal range, at 5.6 g/L (IQR 4.5–7.2 g/L) and 5.0 g/L (IQR 4.0–6.1 g/L), respectively (P = 0.009). Serum ferritin levels, C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), triglycerides (TG) were significantly increased in group 1 compared to those in the control. TG levels were 1.3 mmol/L in the control, while that in group 1 was 1.8 mmol/L. Multiple linear regression showed that the predicting factors of Fbg in the control group were serum ferritin and CRP, R(2) = 0.295; in group 1, serum ferritin, CRP, and TG, R(2) = 0.473. CONCLUSIONS: Fbg in all COVID-19 patients is related to serum ferritin and CRP involved in inflammation. Furthermore, in COVID-19 patients with insulin resistance, Fbg is linearly positively correlated with TG.

Recent computational studies have reported that withanone and withaferin A, phytochemicals found in Withania somnifera, target viral main protease (M(Pro)) and host transmembrane TMPRSS2, and glucose related protein 78 (GRP78), respectively, implicating their potential as viral entry inhibitors. Absence of specific treatment against SARS-CoV-2 infection has encouraged exploration of phytochemicals as potential antivirals. AIM: This study aimed at in silico exploration, along with in vitro and in vivo validation of antiviral efficacy of the phytochemical withanone. METHODS: Through molecular docking, molecular dynamic (MD) simulation and electrostatic energy calculation the plausible biochemical interactions between withanone and the ACE2-RBD complex were investigated. These in silico observations were biochemically validated by ELISA-based assays. Withanone-enriched extract from W. somnifera was tested for its ability to ameliorate clinically relevant pathological features, modelled in humanized zebrafish through SARS-CoV-2 recombinant spike (S) protein induction. RESULTS: Withanone bound efficiently at the interacting interface of the ACE2-RBD complex and destabilized it energetically. The electrostatic component of binding free energies of the complex was significantly decreased. The two intrachain salt bridge interactions (K31-E35) and the interchain long-range ion-pair (K31-E484), at the ACE2-RBD interface were completely abolished by withanone, in the 50 ns simulation. In vitro binding assay experimentally validated that withanone efficiently inhibited (IC(50)=0.33 ng/mL) the interaction between ACE2 and RBD, in a dose-dependent manner. A withanone-enriched extract, without any co-extracted withaferin A, was prepared from W. somnifera leaves. This enriched extract was found to be efficient in ameliorating human-like pathological responses induced in humanized zebrafish by SARS-CoV-2 recombinant spike (S) protein. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, this study provided experimental validation for computational insight into the potential of withanone as a potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus entry into the host cells.",2021-03-11,"Balkrishna, Acharya; Pokhrel, Subarna; Singh, Hoshiyar; Joshi, Monali; Mulay, Vallabh Prakash; Haldar, Swati; Varshney, Anurag",Drug Des Devel Ther,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/a2373ead3a5d347ec982249e14a8a004d8f9b9e9.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7961299.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33737804/; https://doi.org/10.2147/dddt.s292805,232259741.0

These include the membrane-associated RING-CH (MARCH) family of E3 ubiquitin ligases that, among other functions, downregulate cell surface proteins involved in adaptive immunity. The RING-CH domain of MARCH proteins is thought to function by catalyzing the ubiquitination of the cytoplasmic tails (CTs) of target proteins, leading to their degradation. MARCH proteins have recently been reported to target retroviral envelope glycoproteins (Env) and vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein (VSV-G). However, the mechanism of antiviral activity remains poorly defined. Here we show that MARCH8 antagonizes the full-length forms of HIV-1 Env, VSV-G, Ebola virus glycoprotein (EboV-GP), and the spike (S) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), thereby impairing the infectivity of virions pseudotyped with these viral glycoproteins. This MARCH8-mediated targeting of viral glycoproteins requires the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of the RING-CH domain. We observe that MARCH8 protein antagonism of VSV-G is CT dependent. In contrast, MARCH8-mediated targeting of HIV-1 Env, EboV-GP, and SARS-CoV-2 S protein by MARCH8 does not require the CT, suggesting a novel mechanism of MARCH-mediated antagonism of these viral glycoproteins. Confocal microscopy data demonstrate that MARCH8 traps the viral glycoproteins in an intracellular compartment. We observe that the endogenous expression of MARCH8 in several relevant human cell types is rapidly inducible by type I interferon. These results help to inform the mechanism by which MARCH proteins exert their antiviral activity and provide insights into the role of cellular inhibitory factors in antagonizing the biogenesis, trafficking, and virion incorporation of viral glycoproteins.",2021-03-16,"Lun, Cheng Man; Waheed, Abdul A.; Majadly, Ahlam; Powell, Nicole; Freed, Eric O.",mBio,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/09b8236287c9e6a647213d873dfc3192784e1e64.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8092221.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00219-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33727347/,232262428.0

Several adverse reactions have been reported with vaccination against COVID-19. It is unknown whether adverse reactions to COVID-19 vaccination are severe in individuals with allergies. METHODS: We administered the COVID-19 vaccine to the medical staff at Yamagata University Hospital from March to August 2021. Subsequently, we conducted an online questionnaire-based survey to investigate the presence of allergy and adverse reactions after vaccination and examine the association between allergy and adverse reactions after immunization. RESULTS: Responses were collected from 1586 and 1306 participants after the first and second administration of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, respectively. Adverse reactions included injection site pain, injection site swelling, fever, fatigue or malaise, headache, chills, nausea, muscle pain outside the injection site, and arthralgia. The frequency of some adverse reactions and their severity were higher, and the duration of symptoms was longer in participants with allergies than in those without allergies. Although several participants visited the emergency room for treatment after the first and second vaccinations, no participant was diagnosed with anaphylaxis. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the frequency and severity of adverse reactions after injection of BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine were higher in individuals with allergy; however, no severe adverse reactions such as anaphylaxis or death were observed.

Aim: To understand PCPs' experiences of providing care during the COVID-19 pandemic, with focus on personal risk from COVID-19 and testing. Design and Setting: Qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with PCPs in England, Belgium, the Netherlands, Ireland, Germany, Poland, Greece and Sweden, between April and July 2020. Method: Interviews were analysed using a combination of inductive and deductive thematic analysis techniques. Results: Eighty interviews were conducted, showing that PCPs tried to make sense of their risk of both contracting and severity of COVID-19 by assessing individual risk factors and perceived effectiveness of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). They had limited access to PPE yet continued providing care as their “duty.” Some PCPs felt that they were put in high-risk situations when patients or colleagues were not flagging symptoms of COVID-19. Not having access to testing in the initial stages of the pandemic was somewhat accepted but when available, was valued. Conclusion: Access to adequate PPE and testing, as well as training for staff and education for patients about the importance of ensuring staff safety is crucial.

This is achieved through teaching, whereby planned strategies, based on principles of how people learn, enable learning. Despite Learning Principles being the fundamental tenets of the learning process, how HPs perceive and use Learning Principles in their practice is neglected in the healthcare literature. Objective To identify, describe and map the existing literature on nurses' and HPs' perceptions and use of Learning Principles in parent education practice. Method A scoping review was performed using the Joanna Briggs Institute approach. A comprehensive search of 10 databases and the grey literature was undertaken between March and June 2017 to identify pertinent English-language publications. The search was limited to literature published between 1998 and 2017. Following a screening and inclusion criteria eligibility check, 89 articles were selected for inclusion. Results HPs' perceptions of Learning Principles were diverse, somewhat disorganised, divergent in meaning and implicit. This was until the Dimensions of Learning construct was applied to guide the analyses and mapping. This revealed that HPs, of whom 60.7% were nurses, used Learning Principles in parent education, but only referred to them in the context of Adult Learning. Enablers to HPs using Learning Principles included shared partnerships between parents and HPs, while barriers included parents' health beliefs, psychological issues and organisational assumptions about learning. Evaluation of parents' learning also represented implicit use of Learning Principles by HPs. Conclusion This scoping review is the first to examine HPs' perceptions and use of Learning Principles within parent education practice. The findings reveal a significant gap in this body of knowledge. The paucity of studies containing any explicit descriptions of Learning Principles strongly supports the need for further exploration and codification of Learning Principles, through qualitative methods, whereby a deeper understanding of what is happening in healthcare practice can be established.",2020-03-01,"Thompson, Deryn; Leach, Matthew; Smith, Colleen; Fereday, Jennifer; May, Esther",Heliyon,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e03564; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32211543/,214645060.0

Gene sequences from low pathogenic (LPAIV) (A/mallard/MN/410/2000(H5N2) and an a high pathogenic (HPAIV) (A/Northern pintail/Washington/40964/2014(H5N2)) influenza A virus (IAV) were used to generate the rHA proteins. Respiratory and intestinal tracts from chickens, ducks (Mallard, Pekin, Muscovy), and turkeys of different age groups were used to detect rHA binding with protein histochemistry, which was quantified as the median area of binding (MAB) for statistical analysis. Turkeys had significant differences in the HPAIV rHA binding in the respiratory tract, with younger turkeys having higher levels of binding in the lung compared to the older group. In the intestinal tract, younger turkeys had higher levels of binding compared to the older birds. Using LPAIV, only turkeys had overall significant differences in the respiratory tract MAB, with the older birds having higher levels of binding compared to the younger group. We saw no age-related differences in the overall intestinal tract rHA binding. Age-related differences in rHA binding of the LPAIV and HPAIV rHA demonstrated in this study may partially, but not completely, explain differences in host susceptibility to infection observed during avian influenza outbreaks and in experimental infection studies. ABSTRACT: The 2014 outbreak of clade 2.3.4.4A highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) led to the culling of millions of commercial chickens and turkeys and death of various wild bird species. In this outbreak, older chickens and turkeys were commonly infected, and succumbed to clinical disease compared to younger aged birds such chicken broilers. Some experimental studies using waterfowl species have shown age-related differences in susceptibility to clinical disease with HPAI viruses. Here, we evaluate differences in H5 Hemagglutinin (HA) tissue binding across age groups, using recombinant H5 HA (rHA) proteins generated using gene sequences from low pathogenic (A/mallard/MN/410/2000(H5N2 (LPAIV)) and a HPAIV (A/Northern pintail/Washington/40964/2014(H5N2)) influenza A virus (IAV). Respiratory and intestinal tracts from chickens, ducks (Mallard, Pekin, Muscovy) and turkeys of different age groups were used to detect rHA binding with protein histochemistry, which was quantified as the median area of binding (MAB) used for statistical analysis. There were species and tissue specific differences in the rHA binding among the age groups; however, turkeys had significant differences in the HPAIV rHA binding in the respiratory tract, with younger turkeys having higher levels of binding in the lung compared to the older group. In addition, in the intestinal tract, younger turkeys had higher levels of binding compared to the older birds. Using LPAIV, similar species and tissues, specific differences were seen among the age groups; however, only turkeys had overall significant differences in the respiratory tract MAB, with the older birds having higher levels of binding compared to the younger group. No age-related differences were seen in the overall intestinal tract rHA binding.

Despite intense study, the immunologic response to the infection is only partially understood. In addition to older age and ethnicity, patients with comorbidities including obesity, diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, malignancy, renal, and pulmonary disease may experience severe outcomes. Some patients with primary immunodeficiency (PID) and secondary immunodeficiency also appear to be at increased risk from COVID-19. In addition to vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2, patients with PIDs often have chronic pulmonary disease and may not respond to vaccines, which exacerbates their long-term risk. Patients with common variable immunodeficiency disorders, the most frequent symptomatic PID in adults and children, have a spectrum of B- and T-cell defects. It may be possible to stratify their risk for severe COVID-19 based on age, ethnicity, the severity of the T-cell defect, and the presence of other comorbidities. Patients with common variable immunodeficiency disorders and other immunodeficiencies are at risk for Chronic COVID-19, a dangerous stalemate between a suboptimal immune response and SARS-CoV-2. Intra-host viral evolution could result in the rapid emergence of vaccine-resistant mutants and variants of high consequence; it is a public health emergency. Vaccination and prevention of Chronic COVID-19 in immunodeficient patients is therefore of the utmost priority. Having a reliable diagnostic assay for T-cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is critical for evaluating responses to vaccines in these patients.

The objectives of this study were to find out if it was possible to prevent, or delay, the local outbreaks of COVID-19 through restrictions on travel from abroad and if the virus has already established in-country transmission, to what extent would its impact be mitigated through quarantine of symptomatic patients?"" Methods :These questions were addressed in the context of India, using simple mathematical models of infectious disease transmission. While there remained important uncertainties in the natural history of COVID-19, using hypothetical epidemic curves, some key findings were illustrated that appeared insensitive to model assumptions, as well as highlighting critical data gaps. Results :It was assumed that symptomatic quarantine would identify and quarantine 50 per cent of symptomatic individuals within three days of developing symptoms. In an optimistic scenario of the basic reproduction number (R00) being 1.5, and asymptomatic infections lacking any infectiousness, such measures would reduce the cumulative incidence by 62 per cent. In the pessimistic scenario of R0=4, and asymptomatic infections being half as infectious as symptomatic, this projected impact falls to two per cent. Interpretation & conclusions :Port-of-entry-based entry screening of travellers with suggestive clinical features and from COVID-19-affected countries, would achieve modest delays in the introduction of the virus into the community. Acting alone, however, such measures would be insufficient to delay the outbreak by weeks or longer. Once the virus establishes transmission within the community, quarantine of symptomatics may have a meaningful impact on disease burden.

Due to the sporadic occurrence of the Ebola infection, there is insufficient research regarding how the United States emergency nurses provide care to patients potentially infected with the Ebola virus and the nurses’ motivation to protect themselves when providing care to these patients. This study was aimed to investigate the predictors of emergency room nurse’s protection motivation. Method A cross-sectional design was employed in the study. A survey developed based on a modified Protection Motivation Theory was administered to randomly selected emergency room nurses who are members of the Emergency Nurses Association. Descriptive statistics, nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis H-Test (as well as post hoc Dunn-Bonferroni test), Spearman Rho correlation, and Stepwise Multiple Linear regression were conducted for data analysis. Result Protection motivation was found in two components: proactive and passive protection motivation. The regression analysis indicated that response efficacy (β=.27, p<.001) and self-efficacy (β=.17, p<.01) significantly predict emergency nurses’ proactive protection motivation, while perceived vulnerability (β=.26, p<.001), response cost (β=.19, p=.001) and knowledge (β=-.15, p<.01) significantly predict emergency nurses’ passive protection motivation. Conclusion Results indicate the need for interventions to improve emergency nurses’ response efficacy, self-efficacy, and knowledge, while simultaneously reducing the nurses’ perceived vulnerability and response cost. Such interventions would be expected to proactively motivate nurses to protect themselves when providing care to patients that exhibit the signs and symptoms of an Ebola infection and reduce their passive protection motivation.",2020-05-06,"Leigh, Laurasona; Taylor, Colleen; Glassman, Tavis; Thompson, Amy; Sheu, Jiunn-Jye",J Emerg Nurs,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/4b6c121367723023ac757265b4b0f40bce5c8bf0.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7200349.xml.json,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0099176720301495?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jen.2020.05.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32800328/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0099176720301495,218503623.0

Drawbacks linked to the use of alum, such as the formation of granuloma at the site of injection, have led to suggestions of novel allergen carriers. An alternative carrier is 2 μm carbohydrate‐based particles (CBPs). In mouse, allergen‐coupled CBPs have been demonstrated to skew the allergen‐specific immune response towards a Th1‐like activity (Grönlund et al. Immunology, 2002). We here coupled the recombinant major cat allergen Fel d 1 to CBPs (CBP‐Fel d 1) by cyanogen‐bromide activation, resulting in covalent binding. The effect of CBP‐Fel d 1 on monocyte‐derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) from healthy human blood donors was studied. We found that the majority of the CD1a(+) MDDCs were capable of taking up FITC‐labelled CBP‐Fel d 1, as demonstrated by flow cytometry and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Furthermore, incubation with CBP‐Fel d 1 resulted in an upregulation of the costimulatory molecule CD86 on the MDDCs, which was not observed with Fel d 1 or CBPs alone. Finally, CBP‐Fel d 1 induced a fivefold increase in the release of the pro‐inflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor (TNF)‐α and a fourfold increase in the release of the chemokine interleukin‐8 from MDDCs.

OBJECTIVES To present the results of a systematic scientific literature search performed on papers published from April 1st to April 30th, 2020. METHODS A systematic search was performed on PubMed, Embase, Scopus, CINAHL, PEDro, Web of Science and the main international guideline databases for articles published (including Epub), in English, from April 1st to April 30th, 2020. Papers were included if they reported on one of the following: 1) prevalence and features of the emerging disability after Covid-19; 2) rehabilitation strategies applied for Covid-19 patients, regardless of setting or stage; 3) information about rehabilitation services after Covid-19; 4) impact on diseases of rehabilitative interest; 5) complications of rehabilitative interest. RESULTS Out of 445 articles retrieved for the time frame, 50 were finally included for qualitative analysis. They consist of 7 guidelines, 1 scoping review, 1 randomized controlled trial, 4 descriptive studies (qualitative), 1 case series, 1 case report, and 35 expert opinions. CONCLUSIONS This systematic rapid living review showed an increasing evidence on rehabilitation needs due to COVID-19 outbreak during April 2020. The main novelties include: 1) the first appearance of epidemiological data on the likely high incidence of neurological complications/disabling sequelae in patients hospitalized for COVID-19; 2) rapid guidelines on the management of chronically disabled patients in the COVID-19 era; 3) advices to provide COVID-19 patients with early respiratory rehabilitation in the acute phase, and with telemonitoring and telerehabilitation in the post-acute phase.

URMs have increased morbidity and mortality from COVID-19. We surveyed IBD patients to assess COVID vaccination attitudes, particularly among URMs. METHODS: In May and June 2021, all 822 adult patients with IBD, medically homed at a tertiary IBD referral center and safety net hospital, and with access to the electronic patient portal, were sent an electronic survey assessing their attitudes regarding COVID-19 vaccination. An additional 115 without access to the patient portal were contacted by phone. Demographic and clinical data were recorded. The primary outcome was vaccination hesitancy, defined as: likely will become vaccinated later this year, but not immediately; unsure if they will get the vaccine; or do not want the vaccine. Multivariable logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (aOR) of factors associated with vaccination intent. RESULTS: The mean age was 46.6 years (SD 15.1). 210/1029 patients responded to the survey: 150/822 (18.2%) electronically and 60/115 (52.2%) by phone. Overall vaccine hesitancy rate was 11.9%, significantly higher in younger (aOR for 10-year increments, 0.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.46–0.90, p = 0.011), Hispanic (aOR, 7.67; 95% CI, 2.99–21.3, p < 0.0002), and Black patients (aOR, 3.52; 95% CI 1.11–11.1, p = 0.050). Safety concerns were the most cited reasons for vaccine hesitancy. CONCLUSIONS: URM patients were more vaccine hesitant. Future studies should further explore factors leading to lower vaccination rates among these groups and strategies to improve COVID-19 vaccination rates.

IL-6 inhibitors agents have been used as treatment options for COVID-19, yet their benefit as therapeutic agents remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to synthesize the available evidence on the potential therapeutic effect of IL-6 inhibitor agents for the treatment of COVID-19. METHODS: Two authors initially screened and reviewed the relevant studies from available databases. The data extracted will be tabulated and analyzed for the outcomes. The primary outcome was mortality. Secondary outcomes included discharge from the hospital, length of stay, and requirement for mechanical ventilation. The quality of each study was assessed using OCEBM ratings. RESULTS: We reviewed 18 studies with a total of 3303 subjects. Tocilizumab was the most commonly used in the studies (15 studies). Meta-analysis of included studies revealed significant reduction in mortality with tocilizumab and sarilumab (RR = 0.61, 95% CI 0.49–0.76). Other outcomes including hospital discharge (RR = 1.04, 95% CI 0.86–1.24), length of stay (mean difference –1.96 days, 95% CI –4.24 to 0.33) or requirement for mechanical ventilation (RR = 0.68, 95% CI 0.32–1.45) revealed no differences of IL-6 inhibitor agents compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: Available evidence suggests that IL-6 inhibitor agents reduce the risk of mortality in COVID-19, especially in severe conditions.

Despite the increased risk of COVID-19 for the IDD community, there has been less attention drawn to the impact of the pandemic on people with IDD, especially beyond their health and safety. Yet, PWIDD also face unique challenges as a result of the pandemic compared to other populations. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the quality of life outcomes of PWIDD. METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of Personal Outcome Measures® interviews from 2019 to 2020 (n = 2284). RESULTS: There were significant differences in the following quality of life outcomes of PWIDD between 2019 and 2020: continuity and security; interact with other members of the community; participate in the life of the community; intimate relationships; and, choose goals. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively hindered the quality of life outcomes of PWIDD in a number of different areas. While the pandemic has been undoubtably hard on the IDD community, in many ways it has simply intensified an underfunded and fractured IDD service system.

Nurses at all levels are charged with the task of ensuring that patients receive HP services. However, their competence in addressing this challenge needs further exploration. This study assessed the influence of HP knowledge and perceptions in nurses’ HP practice. METHODS: The study was conducted using a self-administered questionnaire among 184 nurses randomly sampled from a tertiary hospital. Questions bordered on respondents’ demographics, knowledge, perception, and practice of HP. Responses were retrieved and analysed using IBM SPSS Statistics, Version 26.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp, 2019. RESULTS: Analysis showed a statistically significant relationship between participants demographics and possessing adequate knowledge to provide HP services. Statistically significant relationships were found amongst the following variables: ‘A holistic knowledge of disease pathology and processes are vital for effective care of patients’ and ‘education of patients on medication’ p = 0.001, ‘awareness of importance of educating patients about their condition’ and ‘patients encouraged to engage in healthy lifestyle’ p < 0.001. CONCLUSION: Data showed that nurses’ knowledge regarding HP had a strong influence on their perception of HP. Their perception of HP in turn strongly influenced their practice of the same.

We synthesized a panel of contiguous cDNAs that spanned the entire genome. Following contig assembly into genome-length cDNA, transfected full-length transcripts recovered several recombinant viruses (rMERS-CoV) that contained the expected marker mutations inserted into the component clones. Because the wild-type MERS-CoV contains a tissue culture-adapted T1015N mutation in the S glycoprotein, rMERS-CoV replicated ~0.5 log less efficiently than wild-type virus. In addition, we ablated expression of the accessory protein ORF5 (rMERS•ORF5) and replaced it with tomato red fluorescent protein (rMERS-RFP) or deleted the entire ORF3, 4, and 5 accessory cluster (rMERS-ΔORF3-5). Recombinant rMERS-CoV, rMERS-CoV•ORF5, and MERS-CoV-RFP replicated to high titers, whereas MERS-ΔORF3-5 showed 1-1.5 logs reduced titer compared with rMERS-CoV.

This study aimed to examine the impact of this disruption on graduate students and postdoctoral fellows completing laboratory-based research in Canada. We used an anonymous online survey and semi-structured interviews to document the experiences of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows during laboratory closures and following the transition to working from home. We employed mixed-method analysis of survey and interview data to identify shared experiences, feelings, concerns, and supports.Respondents’ emotions reported from different points during the COVID-19 laboratory closures align with previously described Kübler-Ross model of grief following change. Respondents describe closure processes as chaotic and confusing, primarily due to inconsistent communication between graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, supervisors, and administration. Respondents reported increased anxiety during closures, however, those who experienced uniform laboratory closures also developed a sense of solidarity and safety while those with staggered shutdowns did not. Graduate students and postdoctoral fellows reported increased indications of distress while working from home. Four key barriers to working from home were described;technical issues, domestic distractions, decreased motivation, and poor mental health. Five key supports while working at home were also identified, including financial security, social connections, establishing and maintaining routines, mental health support, and support from supervisors and administration. Respondents had concerns of how COVID-19 might impact them, including decreasing competitiveness applicants while limiting future employment opportunities. Finally, we outline five types of supports which can be implemented by supervisors and administrators to support graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to return to the laboratory, including;personal protective equipment and protocols, understanding and empathy, guidance and direction, timeline support, and financial support.

Such fluctuations suggest that zinc(II) ions are signalling ions used for the regulation of proteins. One function is the inhibition of enzymes. It is quite common that enzymes bind zinc(II) ions with micro- or nanomolar affinities in their active sites that contain catalytic dyads or triads with a combination of glutamate (aspartate), histidine and cysteine residues, which are all typical zinc-binding ligands. However, for such binding to be physiologically significant, the binding constants must be compatible with the cellular availability of zinc(II) ions. The affinity of inhibitory zinc(II) ions for receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase β is particularly high (K (i) = 21 pM, pH 7.4), indicating that some enzymes bind zinc almost as strongly as zinc metalloenzymes. The competitive pattern of zinc inhibition for this phosphatase implicates its active site cysteine and nearby residues in the coordination of zinc. Quantitative biophysical data on both affinities of proteins for zinc and cellular zinc(II) ion concentrations provide the basis for examining the physiological significance of inhibitory zinc-binding sites in proteins and the role of zinc(II) ions in cellular signalling.

This might have made hospital staff develop sympathy, understanding for the patients` and family’s needs, and a better communication. OBJECTIVES: To investigate if there is a relation between the mutual change in attitude between citizens and hospital staff during the first COVID-19 outbreak, and the incidence of violence cases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a cross sectional study conducted at Rambam Medical Center (RMC) in Israel. The data about the number of violence cases were collected from the security department, and the data about hospital wards activity were collected from the hospital Business Intelligence (BI) software. The number of violence cases in relation to the number of Emergency Department (ED) visits, admissions to hospital wards, and length of stay (LOS) were compared during the COVID-19 outbreak to the corresponding period in 2019 using the T- test. The difference in the incidence of violence between general population and people with a psychiatric or social disorder (like drug abuse and criminal background) in both periods were also compared using the Fisher exact test. RESULTS: During the first COVID-19 outbreak, there were 6 violence cases against medical staff out of 24,740 visits to the ED, vs. 21 cases out of 30,759 visits during the same periods in 2019 (P < 0.05). There were 19 violence cases in the whole hospital with 14,482 admissions in 2020 vs. 51 violence cases of 17,599 admissions in 2019 (P < 0.05). Violence against security guards in the entire hospital dropped from 20 to 11 cases, and in the set of the ED, from 13 to 4 cases in both periods respectively. A 20 % decrease in the number of visits to the ED, might have influenced the average LOS during the study period, 2020 compared to 2019 (4.4 + 0.45 vs. 5.4 + 0.36 h. (P < 0.001). The ratio of violence among general population vs. people with a psychiatric or social background revealed a non-significant change in both periods (P = 0.75 and P = 0.69) respectively. DISCUSSION: The COVID-19 outbreak supplied some evidence that a change in environmental conditions, trust, waiting time, personal attitude and communication might have reduced violence against hospital staff. CONCLUSIONS: Except for violence coming from patients with psychiatric or social disorders, most other violence cases might be reduced if the environment conditions and attitudes of both citizens and staff are improved.",2021-06-17,"Basis, Fuad; Moskovitz, Kobi; Tzafrir, Shay",Isr J Health Policy Res,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/00094c04cbd8e0241c3f6cda89b41a79e4bab223.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8210496.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13584-021-00471-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34140034/,235467252.0

Antibody serology can also be used retrospectively for population-level surveillance to provide a more complete estimate of total infections. Ebola surveillance efforts rely on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), which restrict testing to laboratories and are not adaptable for use in resource-limited settings. In this manuscript, we describe a paper-based immunoassay capable of detecting anti-Ebola IgG using Ebola virus envelope glycoprotein ectodomain (GP) as the affinity reagent. We evaluated seven monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against GP—KZ52, 13C6, 4G7, 2G4, c6D8, 13F6, and 4F3—to elucidate the impact of binding affinity and binding epitope on assay performance and, ultimately, result interpretation. We used biolayer interferometry to characterize the binding of each antibody to GP before assessing their performance in our paper-based device. Binding affinity (K(D)) and on rate (k(on)) were major factors influencing the sensitivity of the paper-based immunoassay. mAbs with the best K(D) (3–25 nM) exhibited the lowest limits of detection (ca. μg mL(−1)), while mAbs with K(D) > 25 nM were undetectable in our device. Additionally, and most surprisingly, we determined that observed signals in paper devices were directly proportional to k(on). These results highlight the importance of ensuring that the quality of recognition reagents is sufficient to support desired assay performance and suggest that the strength of an individual’s immune response can impact the interpretation of assay results.

The results showed that the mean and standard deviation (SD) of the remote experiments' speech reception threshold (SRT) were higher than those of the laboratory experiments.

In addition, the antitumor potency of local isolates from Indonesia, which are known to be less toxic than the control isolate ATCC 43894, has not yet been tested. The study aimed to analyze local strains of E. coli O157:H7 as a proapoptosis agent on the T47 breast cancer cell line. Methods: As many as 30 culture cells of T47D breast cancer cell line were subjected to purified extracts of Shiga-like toxin originating from 5 local isolates of E. coli O157:H7: KL-48(2), SM-25(1), SM-7(1), DS-21(4), and 1 isolate ATCC 43894 which was used as a control. Toxin production of each isolate was detected using a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the treatment of cell lines was observed for 24 hours, with 2 replications; 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide tests and acridine orange/ethidium bromide double staining assays were used for detection and analyses of apoptosis. Results: The study showed 2 local strains of E. coli O157:H7 (codes KL-48(2) and SM-25(1)) had toxins positive at titer 5 and 10 µg/100 µL. These titers were lower than the control isolate ATCC 43894, but they had a necrosis effect higher (P < .05), ie, 80.3%, than control isolate, ie, 63.3%. Other local strain SM-25(1) also had a good necrosis effect. It has a nondifferent necrosis effect (P > .05) with the control isolate ATCC 43894, ie, 13.0% from 13.3%.

A few researchers and journalists described a new form of fatigue associated with a massive use of technology, including videoconferencing platforms. In this study, this type of fatigue was referred to as Online Fatigue. A new tool (the Online Fatigue Scale) was developed, and its psychometric properties were evaluated. This tool was used to assess Online Fatigue among Italian academics and to examine its associations with psychological and physical health. METHODS: An online survey was conducted in December 2020 on a sample of Italian academics. Besides the Online Fatigue Scale (11 items) used to assess Online Fatigue, the survey was composed of questionnaires (including validated measures) focused on sociodemographic and job-related information, technostress creators, health status, psychological well-being, and COVID-related perceived distress. The psychometric properties of the Online Fatigue Scale were evaluated, and statistical analyses were conducted to examine the associations between Online Fatigue and all the other variables. RESULTS: Participants were 307 academics aged 24–70 years old (mean age = 40.7; SD = 10.1). The Online Fatigue Scale showed good psychometric properties. Two subscales were identified: Off-Balance Fatigue and Virtual Relations Fatigue. High levels of Off-Balance Fatigue were associated with a greater use of technology, female gender, and presence of minor children. Participants with high scores on both subscales reported a greater frequency of psychosomatic symptoms, unhealthy habits, poorer psychological well-being, and greater Covid-related perceived distress. CONCLUSIONS: The Online Fatigue Scale can be considered a reliable tool to assess Online Fatigue, which was significantly detected in our sample of Italian academics, along with its negative effects on physical and psychological health.

However, an optimal cardiac biomarker for predicting COVID-19 prognosis has not been identified. Methods: The PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase databases were searched for published articles between December 1, 2019 and September 8, 2021. Eligible studies that examined the anomalies of different cardiac biomarkers in patients with COVID-19 were included. The prevalence and odds ratios (ORs) were extracted. Summary estimates and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were obtained through meta-analyses. Results: A total of 63 studies, with 64,319 patients with COVID-19, were enrolled in this meta-analysis. The prevalence of elevated cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and myoglobin (Mb) in the general population with COVID-19 was 22.9 (19–27%) and 13.5% (10.6–16.4%), respectively. However, the presence of elevated Mb was more common than elevated cTnI in patients with severe COVID-19 [37.7 (23.3–52.1%) vs.30.7% (24.7–37.1%)]. Moreover, compared with cTnI, the elevation of Mb also demonstrated tendency of higher correlation with case-severity rate (Mb, r = 13.9 vs. cTnI, r = 3.93) and case-fatality rate (Mb, r = 15.42 vs. cTnI, r = 3.04). Notably, elevated Mb level was also associated with higher odds of severe illness [Mb, OR = 13.75 (10.2–18.54) vs. cTnI, OR = 7.06 (3.94–12.65)] and mortality [Mb, OR = 13.49 (9.3–19.58) vs. cTnI, OR = 7.75 (4.4–13.66)] than cTnI. Conclusions: Patients with COVID-19 and elevated Mb levels are at significantly higher risk of severe disease and mortality. Elevation of Mb may serve as a marker for predicting COVID-19-related adverse outcomes.

e8zljxb4,,WHO,Blockchain based Privacy-Preserved Federated Learning for Medical Images: A Case Study of COVID-19 CT Scans,,,,unk,"Medical health care centers are envisioned as a promising paradigm to handle the massive volume of data of COVID-19 patients using artificial intelligence (AI). Traditionally, AI techniques often require centralized data collection and training the model in a single organization, which is most common weakness due to the privacy and security of raw data communication. To solve this challenging task, we propose a blockchain-based federated learning framework that provides collaborative data training solutions by coordinating multiple hospitals to train and share encrypted federated models without leakage of data privacy. The blockchain ledger technology provides the decentralization of federated learning model without any central server. The proposed homomorphic encryption scheme encrypts and decrypts the gradients of model to preserve the privacy. More precisely, the proposed framework: i) train the local model by a novel capsule network to segmentation and classify COVID-19 images, ii) then use the homomorphic encryption scheme to secure the local model that encrypts and decrypts the gradients, and finally the model is shared over a decentralized platform through proposed blockchain-based federated learning algorithm. The integration of blockchain and federated learning leads to a new paradigm for medical image data sharing in the decentralized network.

Objective This study explored pharmacists' roles, barriers and determinants related to their involvement in optimizing prescribed opioids for patients with chronic pain. Setting Community pharmacies in the United Kingdom. Method Semi-structured interviews based on the Theoretical Domains Framework were conducted between January and May 2020 with 20 community pharmacists recruited through professional networks. Data were analysed thematically. Main outcome measure: Pharmacists’ perceived roles, barriers and behavioural determinants in relation to opioid therapy optimization. Result Pharmacists demonstrated desire to contribute to opioid therapy optimization. However, they described that they were often challenged by the lack of relevant knowledge, skills and training, inadequate time and resources, systemic constraints (such as lack of access to medical records and information about diagnosis), and other barriers including relationships with doctors and patients. Conclusion The contribution of community pharmacists to optimize opioid therapy in CNMP is unclear and impeded by lack of appropriate training and systemic constraints. There is a need to develop innovative practice models by addressing the barriers identified in this study to enhance the contribution of community pharmacists in optimization of opioid therapy for chronic pain.

Here we propose intertemporal instruments to provide the basis for widely applied carbon taxes and emission trading systems to finance a net-negative carbon economy(5). We investigate an idealized market approach to incentivize the repayment of previously accrued carbon debt by establishing the responsibility of emitters for the net removal of carbon dioxide through ‘carbon removal obligations’ (CROs). Inherent risks, such as the risk of default by carbon debtors, are addressed by pricing atmospheric CO(2) storage through interest on carbon debt. In contrast to the prevailing literature on emission pathways, we find that interest payments for CROs induce substantially more-ambitious near-term decarbonization that is complemented by earlier and less-aggressive deployment of CDR. We conclude that CROs will need to become an integral part of the global climate policy mix if we are to ensure the viability of ambitious climate targets and an equitable distribution of mitigation efforts across generations.",2021-07-08,"Bednar, Johannes; Obersteiner, Michael; Baklanov, Artem; Thomson, Marcus; Wagner, Fabian; Geden, Oliver; Allen, Myles; Hall, Jim W.",Nature,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/135b192101d71f7c637b5e6223502d7634342915.json; document_parses/pdf_json/8e403d1e264d9bdff15da47406ed7d508894c241.json; document_parses/pdf_json/b7fe8aaecc5c6c80c2d1b31dc44ce737a7140c20.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8356218.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34237772/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03723-9,235776851.0
nel3mfbm,,WHO,Shannon entropy measures for EEG signals in tinnitus,,,,unk,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Tinnitus is known as a common clinical symptom, and it comprehensively is essential to understand the underlying mechanisms. Time-varying EEG is considered an appropriate technique to explore brain regions and related activities, and nonlinear methods may extract the irregularities in the EEG signal and gather more expanded information. Therefore, we studied Shannon Entropy in EEG raw data obtained from normal subjects and compared it to data from chronic tinnitus sufferers before and after an intervention. METHODS: From the qEEG database of Iran University of Medical Sciences, the School of Rehabilitation Sciences, we have selected 23 healthy and 24 chronic tinnitus subjects. Nineteen subjects of the tinnitus group had benefited from a complete course of sound therapy (binaural beat for a month). QEEGs were measured with a 27-channel EEG amplifier in the sitting and eye-closed position for 3 min. Shannon entropy was investigated for all electrodes separately and compared among groups using a one-way ANOVA statistical test. FINDINGS: Our results revealed a significant difference between healthy and tinnitus subjects (p < 0.05). Post-hoc comparisons using the Bonferroni test showed increased entropy in the tinnitus group for all electrodes (p < 0.05) at low frequencies and most electrodes at mid frequencies. In addition, after the intervention, paired t-test showed a reduction in entropy to somehow above normal control levels for all electrodes at low-frequencies. Such results were accompanying clinical improvement after the intervention. CONCLUSION: The increased entropy in tinnitus patients might reflect the chaotic behavior of the brain. Nonlinear methods in EEG studies (Entropy) could be of great importance in understanding tinnitus neurophysiology and might potentially be a suitable criterion for clinical practice.",2021,"Sadeghijam, Maryam; Talebian, Saeed; Mohsen, Samer; Akbari, Mehdi; Pourbakht, Akram",Neurosci Lett,,#mdl-34352341,,,,,236641863.0

RESULTS: Of the 46 sexagenary patients who participated in the study, 40 completed the study. After ASD closure, the clinical symptoms of the patients significantly improved, and the number of patients with dyspnea and palpitations significantly decreased after the operation. According to the echocardiographic results, few patients had a tiny residual shunt after closure, but the shunt disappeared completely at the three-month follow-up. The size of the right ventricular cavity was significantly smaller postoperatively compared with preoperatively. Regarding the patients’ quality of life, their feedback in all dimensions of the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (or SF-36) was significantly improved at the three-month follow-up, and it remained improved at the one-year follow-up.

We compared the clinical characteristics, inflammatory response, and outcomes between patients with and without microbiologically confirmed ICU-acquired pneumonia. DESIGN Prospective observational study. SETTING ICUs of a university teaching hospital. PATIENTS We prospectively collected 270 consecutive patients with ICU-acquired pneumonia. Patients were clustered according to positive or negative microbiologic results. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS We compared the characteristics and outcomes between both groups. Negative microbiology was found in 82 patients (30%). Both groups had similar baseline severity scores. Patients with negative microbiology presented more frequently chronic renal failure (15 [18%] vs 11 [6%]; p=0.003), chronic heart disorders (35 [43%] vs 55 [29%]; p=0.044), less frequently previous intubation (44 [54%] vs 135 [72%]; p=0.006), more severe hypoxemia (PaO2/FIO2: 165±73 mm Hg vs 199±79 mm Hg; p=0.001), and shorter ICU stay before the onset of pneumonia (5±5 days vs 7±9 days; p=0.001) compared with patients with positive microbiology. The systemic inflammatory response was similar between both groups. Negative microbiology resulted in less changes of empiric treatment (33 [40%] vs 112 [60%]; p=0.005) and shorter total duration of antimicrobials (13±6 days vs 17±12 days; p=0.006) than positive microbiology. Following adjustment for potential confounders, patients with positive microbiology had higher hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio 2.96, 95% confidence interval 1.24-7.04, p=0.014) and lower 90-day survival (adjusted hazard ratio 0.50, 95% confidence interval 0.27-0.94, p=0.031), with a nonsignificant lower 28-day survival. CONCLUSIONS Although the possible influence of previous intubation in mortality of both groups is not completely discarded, negative microbiologic findings in clinically suspected ICU-acquired pneumonia are associated with less frequent previous intubation, shorter duration of antimicrobial treatment, and better survival.

Until now, the cytotoxic T cell response has not been very well characterized in COVID-19 patients. Here, we analyzed the differentiation and cytotoxic profile of T cells in 30 cases of mild COVID-19 during acute infection. SARS-CoV-2 infection induced a cytotoxic response of CD8+ T cells, but not CD4+ T cells, characterized by the simultaneous production of granzyme A and B as well as perforin within different effector CD8+ T cell subsets. PD-1-expressing CD8+ T cells also produced cytotoxic molecules during acute infection, indicating that they were not functionally exhausted. However, in COVID-19 patients over the age of 80 years, the cytotoxic T cell potential was diminished, especially in effector memory and terminally differentiated effector CD8+ cells, showing that elderly patients have impaired cellular immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Our data provide valuable information about T cell responses in COVID-19 patients that may also have important implications for vaccine development.IMPORTANCE Cytotoxic T cells are responsible for the elimination of infected cells and are key players in the control of viruses. CD8+ T cells with an effector phenotype express cytotoxic molecules and are able to perform target cell killing. COVID-19 patients with a mild disease course were analyzed for the differentiation status and cytotoxic profile of CD8+ T cells. SARS-CoV-2 infection induced a vigorous cytotoxic CD8+ T cell response. However, this cytotoxic profile of T cells was not detected in COVID-19 patients over the age of 80 years. Thus, the absence of a cytotoxic response in elderly patients might be a possible reason for the more frequent severity of COVID-19 in this age group than in younger patients.",2020,"Westmeier, Jaana; Paniskaki, Krystallenia; Karaköse, Zehra; Werner, Tanja; Sutter, Kathrin; Dolff, Sebastian; Overbeck, Marvin; Limmer, Andreas; Liu, Jia; Zheng, Xin; Brenner, Thorsten; Berger, Marc M; Witzke, Oliver; Trilling, Mirko; Lu, Mengji; Yang, Dongliang; Babel, Nina; Westhoff, Timm; Dittmer, Ulf; Zelinskyy, Gennadiy",mBio (Online),,#781095,,,,,221355436.0

Due to the measures for social distancing, there was a drop in the air pollution concentration in Sao Paulo. Starting on March 16th, 2020, we broke 90 days of social distancing into 13 weeks and compared to an equivalent period in 2019. We investigated the air quality improvement during the quarantine period and compared the associated avoided deaths to COVID-19 burden deaths. Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) was the best indicator of air quality in the analyzed weeks, since its reduction reached 58 %. Our study showed that the 5,623 deaths occurred during the analyzed weeks of quarantine represents an economic health loss of US$ 10.5 billion. In opposite, we observed a significant air quality improvement due to pollutants concentrations’reductions during the analyzed weeks. Considering PM10, PM2.5 and NO2, the decrease of concentration levels respectively avoided 78, 337 and 387 premature deaths and prevented up to US$ 1.5 billion on health costs.

In oncofertility, patients should receive their fertility preservation treatments urgently even in limited resource settings before initiation of anticancer therapy. Therefore, it is very crucial to learn more about oncofertility practice in limited resource settings such as in developing countries that suffer often from shortage of healthcare services provided to young patients with cancer. METHODS: As an extrapolation during the global crisis of COVID-19 pandemic, we surveyed oncofertility centers from 14 developing countries (Egypt, Tunisia, Brazil, Peru, Panama, Mexico, Colombia, Guatemala, Argentina, Chile, Nigeria, South Africa, Saudi Arabia, and India). Survey questionnaire included questions on the availability and degree of utilization of fertility preservation options in case of childhood cancer, breast cancer, and blood cancer. RESULTS: All surveyed centers responded to all questions. Responses and their calculated oncofertility scores showed different domestic standards for oncofertility practice in case of childhood cancer, breast cancer, and blood cancer in the developing countries under limited resource settings. CONCLUSIONS: Medical practice in limited resource settings has become a critical topic especially after the global crisis of COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding the resources necessary to provide oncofertility treatments is important until the current COVID-19 pandemic resolves.

Comparing crude coverage between groups is misleading because of different age structures and socio-economic differences. To describe inequalities in COVID19 vaccine initiation in Israel we analysed the interaction of age and population groups in terms of dose 1 vaccine coverage METHODS: We calculated cumulative age-specific first COVID19 vaccine coverage by population group (Ultra-Orthodox Jewish, Arab, General Jewish). We calculated the relative differences in vaccine coverage between population groups within each age group, and between age groups within each population, using ANOVA and binomial regression after adjusting for socio-economic status FINDINGS: 8,507,723 individuals in 268 cities were included. Compared with the general Jewish population, coverage was lowest in the Ultra-Orthodox population in all age groups (range -12% among 60+ to -52.8% among 10-19 years olds, p<0.001). In all groups, the proportion of vaccinated individuals in younger age groups relative to those aged 60+ decreased with decreasing age and were smallest in the Ultra-Orthodox groups. For example, within the general Jewish population, people aged 20-29 were 14% less likely to be vaccinated than those aged 60+ while within the Ultra-Orthodox population it was 34.5% INTERPRETATION: In all age groups, the Ultra-Orthodox population had the lowest vaccine coverage. Differences persisted after adjusting for socio-economic status.

Recent work identified memory-like CXCR5(+) TCF1(+) CD8(+) T cells that sustain T cell responses during persistent infection and proliferate upon anti-PD1 treatment. Approaches to expand these cells are sought. We show that blockade of interferon type 1 (IFN-I) receptor leads to CXCR5(+) CD8(+) T cell expansion in an IL-27– and STAT1-dependent manner. IFNAR1 blockade promoted accelerated cell division and retention of TCF1 in virus-specific CD8(+) T cells. We found that CD8(+) T cell–intrinsic IL-27 signaling safeguards the ability of TCF1(hi) cells to maintain proliferation and avoid terminal differentiation or programmed cell death. Mechanistically, IL-27 endowed rapidly dividing cells with IRF1, a transcription factor that was required for sustained division in a cell-intrinsic manner. These findings reveal that IL-27 opposes IFN-I to uncouple effector differentiation from cell division and suggest that IL-27 signaling could be exploited to augment self-renewing T cells in chronic infections and cancer.",2019-08-05,"Huang, Zhe; Zak, Jaroslav; Pratumchai, Isaraphorn; Shaabani, Namir; Vartabedian, Vincent F.; Nguyen, Nhan; Wu, Tuoqi; Xiao, Changchun; Teijaro, John R.",J Exp Med,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/254270af7f396d35475aee946cc1b3f9a3694e29.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6683984.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.20190173; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31164392/,174810380.0

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the association between the development of ESR1 mutation and the clinicopathologic characteristics of patients with MBC. To evaluate the association between the development of ESR1 mutation and clinicopathologic features, a cohort of 22 patients with MBC were retrospectively analyzed using next generation sequencing. In 14 of 22 patients, four mutations were detected on the metastatic site, including Tyr537Ser, Glu542Asp, Leu536Arg and Arg548Cys. Univariate analysis demonstrated that the duration of aromatase inhibitor and selective estrogen receptor modulator treatment, as well as the age of treatment initiation for early-stage breast cancer, were significantly associated with the development of ESR1 mutation.

It aims at answering the following research questions: (1) How did the pandemic affect the subjective health of carers, and what were their experiences with care-related worries and workload? (2) What factors significantly predicted negative changes in these experiences? (3) What were carers’ main difficulties during the first pandemic wave? Results have shown that carers in both samples reported a worsening in mental health (Italy/Hungary: M = 2.25/2.55, SD = 0.93/0.99), and Italian carers also in general health (M = 2.54, SD = 0.98) (on a scale of 1 to 5, with values under “3” representing deterioration). Carers in both samples experienced high worry levels (Italy/Hungary: M = 4.2/3.7, SD = 0.93/0.89) and feeling overwhelmed with care tasks (M = 3.2/3.7, SD = 1.3/1.3) (on a scale of 1 to 5, higher values representing higher worry/work overload). In regression models, all of the above negative experiences were predicted by a combination of factors. Two of these factors stood out in importance due to being a predictor of more than one type of negative experience: a decline in the carer–care receiver relationship, predicting work overload, as well as general and mental health deterioration and being the child of the care receiver, predicting both high worry and subjective work overload.

Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), as essential participators in the tumor microenvironment (TME), play a vital role in tumor progression. Thus, CAFs-targeting therapy is appealing for remodeling TME and sensitizing GC to conventional systemic therapy. METHODS: Amphiphilic SN38 prodrug polymeric micelles (PSN38) and encapsulated the hydrophobic esterase-responsive prodrug of Triptolide (TPL), triptolide-naphthalene sulfonamide (TPL-nsa), were synthesized to form PSN38@TPL-nsa nanoparticles. Then, CAFs were isolated from fresh GC tissues and immortalized. TPL at low dose concentration was used to investigate its effect on CAFs and CAFs-induced GC cells proliferation and migration. The synergistic mechanism and antitumor efficiency of SN38 and TPL co-delivery nanoparticle were investigated both in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: Fibroblast activation protein (FAP), a marker of CAFs, was highly expressed in GC tissues and indicated poorer prognosis. TPL significantly reduced CAFs activity and inhibited CAFs-induced proliferation, migration and chemotherapy resistance of GC cells. In addition, TPL sensitized GC cells to SN38 treatment through attenuated NF-κB activation in both CAFs and GC cells. PSN38@TPL-nsa treatment reduced the expression of collagen, FAP, and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) in tumors. Potent inhibition of primary tumor growth and vigorous anti-metastasis effect were observed after systemic administration of PSN38@TPL-nsa to CAFs-rich peritoneal disseminated tumor and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model of GC. CONCLUSION: TPL suppressed CAFs activity and CAFs-induced cell proliferation, migration and chemotherapy resistance to SN38 of GC. CAFs-targeted TPL and SN38 co-delivery nanoparticles exhibited potent efficacy of antitumor and reshaping TME, which was a promising strategy to treat advanced GC.

9y6v3tj9,,Medline; WHO,Does Walking Reduce Postpartum Depressive Symptoms? A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials,10.1089/jwh.2021.0296,,34704837,unk,"Background: Rising demands for traditional postpartum depression (PPD) treatment options (e.g., psychiatry), especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, are increasingly difficult to meet. More accessible treatment options (e.g., walking) are needed. Our objective is to determine the impact of walking on PPD severity. Methods: A structured search of seven electronic databases for randomized controlled trials published between 2000 and July 29, 2021 was completed. Studies were included if walking was the sole or primary aerobic exercise modality. A random-effects meta-analysis was conducted for studies reporting PPD symptoms measured using a clinically validated tool. A simple count of positive/null effect studies was undertaken as part of a narrative summary. Results: Five studies involving 242 participants were included (mean age = â¼28.9 years; 100% with mild-to-moderate depression). Interventions were 12 (n = 4) and 24 (n = 1) weeks long. Each assessed PPD severity using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), and was included in the meta-analysis. The pooled effect estimate suggests that relative to controls walking yielded clinically significant decreases in mean EPDS scores from baseline to intervention end (pooled mean difference = -4.01; 95% CI: -7.18 to -0.84, I2 = 86%). The narrative summary provides preliminary evidence that walking-only, supervised, and group-based interventions, including 90-120+ minutes per week of moderate-intensity walking, may produce greater EPDS reductions. Conclusions: While limited by a relatively small number of included studies, pooled effect estimates suggest that walking may help mothers manage PPD. This is the first-time walking as treatment for PPD, an exercise modality that uniquely addresses many barriers faced by mothers, has been summarized in a systematic way.

Most antihypertensive are identified as the inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), a key enzyme responsible for the generation of angiotensin II (Ang II), which is a vasoconstricting peptide. Hence, ACE has long been used as a universal target to identify antihypertensive peptides. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is a homolog of ACE but uses Ang II as its key substrate to produce angiotensin (1-7), exerting vasodilatory activity via the mas receptor (MasR). Therefore, ACE2 functions in the opposite way as ACE and is an emerging novel target for cardiovascular therapy. The potential of food protein-derived bioactive peptides in targeting ACE2 has been rarely explored. While, recently we found that IRW, an egg white ovotransferrin-derived antihypertensive peptide, reduced blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats via the ACE2/Ang (1-7)/MasR axis, indicating a new mechanism of food protein-derived bioactive peptides in reducing blood pressure. The objectives of this review are to summarize the functions of the ACE2/Ang (1-7)/MasR axis and to examine its potential roles in the actions of food protein-derived antihypertensive peptides.

0r1cu9yo,,WHO,How many lives do COVID vaccines save? Evidence from Israel,,,,unk,"BackgroundIn December 2020, Israel began a mass vaccination program with the rapid rollout of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 BNT162b2 vaccine for adults in Israel. The campaign vaccinated fewer people than necessary for herd immunity. However, at the same time, government stringency measures in terms of closing public life were decreased. Real-world observational data were used to examine the effect of mass vaccination on Covid-19 mortality. MethodsThe study period to examine the effect of vaccination on mortality was chosen to capture when at least 90% of the population over age 70 were vaccinated for less than seven months. Projected deaths as expected from vaccine efficacy and actual mortality data were compared for the study population with examination of potential confounding effects of government stringency. Average government stringency (Oxford Stringency Index) was calculated in the study period and the preceding period of the pandemic.

64az440b,,WHO,Personality and pediatric bipolar disorder: Toward personalizing psychosocial intervention,,,,unk,"BACKGROUND: Previous research suggests that challenging temperament characteristics (i.e., low mood, irritability and rigidity) are associated with risk for the development of Pediatric Bipolar Disorder (PBD). This study aimed to investigate the connection between PBD and discrete dimensions of the Five Factor Model (FFM) of personality. METHODS: Youth diagnosed with PBD I, II, or NOS, at high risk for the disorder (BD-HR) and healthy controls were recruited from the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Outpatient Clinic at Stanford University School of Medicine. Researchers administered a personality inventory and evaluated current mood state. RESULTS: BD and BD-HR youth scored lower in Emotional Regulation than did HC youth (F (3, 70) = 10.75, p < .001). Within the BD and BD-HR groups, youth with high depression scores scored lower on Extraversion (F (3, 70) = 8.62, p < .001) and Conscientiousness (F (3, 70) = 4.53, p < .01). LIMITATIONS: A major limitation of this study is its cross-sectional design, precluding analysis of whether certain traits or clusters of traits predict PBD or other mood disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Low Emotional Regulation, Conscientiousness, and Agreeableness were associated with PBD; this personality profile clinically corresponds with youth diagnosed with PBD who present with difficulty regulating their emotions, vulnerability to stress, and emotional reactivity. Future research examining personality characteristics in PBD may elucidate further a specific profile to aid clinicians in developing psychosocial interventions for youth with and at high risk of developing PBD.",2020,"Kelman, Jake; Thacher, Abigail; Hossepian, Kristene; Pearlstein, Jennifer; Geraghty, Shauna; Cosgrove, Victoria E",J Affect Disord,,#32734924,,,,,220892856.0

This article focuses on how work-life conflict has been studied with three main objectives. First, to map the challenges of combining work and private life in the neoliberalised university. Second, to conduct a systematic review of the literature on work-life balance in academia. Third, to discuss findings and limitations in order to propose research recommendations.

Here we describe the comparison of screening procedures for hydrolases to be used for the hydrolysis of β-keto esters, the first step in the preparation of β-amino acids. Two of the tested high throughput screening (HTS) assays depend on coupled enzymatic reactions which detect the alcohol released during ester hydrolysis by luminescence or absorption. The third assay detects the pH shift due to acid formation using an indicator dye. To choose the most efficient approach for screening, we assessed these assays with different statistical methods—namely, the classical Z’-factor, standardized mean difference (SSMD), the Kolmogorov-Smirnov-test, and t-statistics. This revealed that all three assays are suitable for HTS, the pH assay performing best. Based on our data we discuss the explanatory power of different statistical measures.

Few reports exist in Latin America, a current epicenter of transmission. Here, we aim to describe the epidemiology and outcomes associated with COVID-19 in Honduras. METHODS: Baseline clinical and epidemiological information of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR confirmed cases detected between March 17th-May 4th in the San Pedro Sula Metropolitan area was collected, and, for hospitalized cases, clinical data was abstracted. Logistic regression models were fit to determine factors associated with hospitalization. RESULTS: 877 COVID-19 cases were identified of which 25% (n=220) were hospitalized. The 19-44-year age group (57.8%) and males (61.3%) were predominant in overall COVID-19 cases. 34% of the cases (n=299) had at least one pre-existing medical condition.

The first-principles calculations revealed that the anisotropic carrier transport property of Zn5In2S8 (Z5) is much stronger than that of ZnIn2S4 (Z1). Furthermore, unsynchronized electron and hole transport leads to higher bulk carrier separation efficiency in Z5. After accelerating the surface photocatalytic reaction rate by Ag2S modification, the differences between 3A/Z5 and 3A/Z1 in the bulk carrier separation were further enlarged. Photoelectrochemical tests confirmed that the bulk charge separation efficiency of 3A/Z5 is 13.70%, which is 7.4 times higher than 3A/Z1 (1.84%). Because of the high bulk carrier separation efficiency, the 3A/Z5 exhibits a promising photocatalytic hydrogen production rate, reaching 3189 µmol h-1 g-1.

Cellular binding and entry by all RV-C, which trigger these episodes, is mediated by the first extracellular domain (EC1) of cadherin-related protein 3 (CDHR3), a surface cadherin-like protein expressed primarily on the apical surfaces of ciliated airway epithelial cells. Although recombinant EC1 is a potent inhibitor of viral infection, there is no molecular description of this protein or its binding site on RV-C. Here we present cryo-electron microscopy (EM) data resolving the EC1 and EC1+2 domains of human CDHR3 complexed with viral isolate C15a. Structure-suggested residues contributing to required interfaces on both EC1 and C15a were probed and identified by mutagenesis studies with four different RV-C genotypes. In contrast to most other rhinoviruses, which bind intercellular adhesion molecule 1 receptors via a capsid protein VP1-specific fivefold canyon feature, the CDHR3 EC1 contacts C15a, and presumably all RV-Cs, in a unique cohesive footprint near the threefold vertex, encompassing residues primarily from viral protein VP3, but also from VP1 and VP2. The EC1+2 footprint on C15a is similar to that of EC1 alone but shows that steric hindrance imposed by EC2 would likely prevent multiprotein binding by the native receptor at any singular threefold vertex.

New agents are urgently needed, however nearly all Phase III trials of GBM patients of the past 25 years have failed to demonstrate improvement in outcomes. In 2019, the National Cancer Institute Clinical Trials and Translational Research Advisory Committee (CTAC) Glioblastoma Working Group (GBM WG) identified 5 broad areas of research thought to be important in the development of new herapeutics for GBM. Among those was optimizing radioresponse for GBM in situ. One such strategy to increase radiation efficacy is the addition of a radiosensitizer to improve the therapeutic ratio by enhancing tumor sensitivity while ideally having minimal to no effect on normal tissue. Historically the majority of trials using radiosensitizers have been unsuccessful, but they provide important guidance in what is required to develop agents more efficiently. Improved target selection is essential for a drug to provide maximal benefit, and once that target is identified it must be validated through pre-clinical studies. Careful selection of appropriate in vitro and in vivo models to demonstrate increased radiosensitivity and suitable bioavailability are then necessary to prove that a drug warrants advancement to clinical investigation. Once investigational agents are validated pre-clinically, patient trials require consistency both in terms of planning study design as well as reporting efficacy and toxicity in order to assess the potential benefit of the drug.

The TAT or D4 peptides were chosen as CPP due to specific target strategies by the charge grouping on the skin surface or target the overexpressed epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) of cell membrane of keratinocytes, respectively. Thus, the nanoparticle characterization results when taken together suggested that designed LCNs maintained their hexagonal phase structure, nanoscale particle size, and low polydispersity index even after drug, lipopolymers, and peptide additions, which are proved to be favorable for topical skin delivery. There were no statistical differences among the LCNs investigated, except for superficial charge of LCN conjugated with TAT which may have altered the LCN zeta potential due to cationic charge of TAT amino acid sequence compared with D4.

We aimed to characterize the impact of disease on overall health, daily life, and perceived well-being in COPD outpatients. Methods We conducted a national, cross-sectional study among pulmonologists and general practitioners (GPs). The St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire for COPD patients (SGRQ-C) was used. Inclusion criteria were a physician's diagnosis of COPD and age ≥40 years. Subjects with a history of lung surgery, lung cancer or COPD exacerbation within the last four weeks were excluded. Results Sixty-seven pulmonologists and 6 GPs enrolled 1175 COPD patients. Two hundred forty-eight of those did not fulfill GOLD criteria for COPD (FEV1/FVC <0.7) and 77 were excluded due to missing data. Finally, 850 patients (62.8% men; mean age 66.2 ± 0.3 (SE) years; mean FEV1%pred. 51.5 ± 0.6 (SE)) were analyzed. Last year, 55.4% reported at least one exacerbation, and 12.7% were hospitalized for COPD exacerbation. Mean SGRQ-C total score was 43.1 ± 0.83 (SE) and mean component scores for symptoms, activity and impacts were 55.6, 55.4 and 30.5, respectively. Half of the patients (50.3%) reported not being able to do any sports and 78.7% stated that their respiratory symptoms did not allow them doing anything they would like to do. In patients with less severe COPD (FEV1pred ≥50% and non-frequent exacerbations), global health status was overrated, ie, estimated as better by the physician than by the patient, while it was underrated in more severe COPD. Conclusion In Austria, the burden of disease in COPD outpatients tends to be underestimated in patients with milder airway obstruction and less exacerbations and overestimated in patients with more severe airway obstruction and frequent exacerbations. Our finding suggests that validated assessment of global health status might decrease these differences of perception.",2020,"Horner, Andreas; Burghuber, Otto C; Hartl, Sylvia; Studnicka, Michael; Merkle, Monika; Olschewski, Horst; Kaiser, Bernhard; Wallner, Eva Maria; Lamprecht, Bernd",International journal of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.2147/copd.s252033; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764911/,220971502.0

The fatigue outcomes derive from the software Sleep, Activity, Fatigue, and Task Effectiveness Fatigue Avoidance Scheduling Tool (SAFTE-FAST). The average minimum SAFTE-FAST effectiveness during critical phases of flight decreases cubically with the number of shifts that elapse totally or partially between mid-night and 6 a.m. within a 30-day period ($N_{NS}$). As a consequence, the relative fatigue risk increases by 23.3% (95% CI, 20.4-26.2%) when increasing $N_{NS}$ from 1 to 13. The average maximum equivalent wakefulness in critical phases also increases cubically with the number of night shifts and exceeds 24 hours for rosters with $N_{NS}$ above 10. The average fatigue hazard area in critical phases of flight varies quadratically with the number of departures and landings within 2 and 6 a.m. ($N_{Wocl}$). These findings demonstrate that both $N_{NS}$ and $ N_{Wocl}$ should be considered as key performance indicators and be kept as low as reasonably practical when building aircrew rosters. The effectiveness scores at 30 minute time intervals allowed a model estimate for the relative fatigue risk as a function of the time of the day, whose averaged values show reasonable qualitative agreement with previous measurements of pilot errors. Tailored analyses of the SAFTE-FAST inputs for afternoon naps before night shifts, commuting from home to station and vice-versa, and bedtime before early-start shifts show relevant group effects ($p<0.001$) comparing the groups with and without afternoon naps, with one or two hours of commuting and with or without the advanced bedtime feature of the SAFTE-FAST software, evidencing the need of a better and more accurate understanding of these parameters when modelling fatigue risk factors.",2022-01-14,"Rodrigues, Tulio E.; Fischer, Frida M.; Helene, Otaviano; Antunes, Eduardo; Furlan, Eduardo; Morteo, Eduardo; Menquini, Alfredo; Lisboa, Joao; Frank, Arnaldo; Simoes, Alexandre; Papazian, Karla; Helene, Andr'e F.",,,,2201.05438,document_parses/pdf_json/aad7a01535da422edb86195fe40264b87d29368e.json,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.05438v2.pdf,245986360.0

Currently available medical options to treat a PDA include indomethacin, ibuprofen or acetaminophen. Wide variation exists in PDA treatment practices across Canada. In view of this large practice variation across Canadian neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), we plan to conduct a comparative effectiveness study of the different pharmacotherapeutic agents used to treat the PDA in preterm infants. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A multicentre prospective observational comparative-effectiveness research study of extremely preterm infants born <29 weeks gestational age with an echocardiography confirmed PDA will be conducted. All participating sites will self-select and adhere to one of the following primary pharmacotherapy protocols for all preterm babies who are deemed to require treatment. 1. Standard dose ibuprofen (10 mg/kg followed by two doses of 5 mg/kg at 24 hours intervals) irrespective of postnatal age (oral/intravenous). 2. Adjustable dose ibuprofen (oral/intravenous) (10 mg/kg followed by two doses of 5 mg/kg at 24 hours intervals if treated within the first 7 days after birth. Higher doses of ibuprofen up to 20 mg/kg followed by two doses of 10 mg/kg at 24 hours intervals if treated after the postnatal age cut-off for lower dose as per the local centre policy). 3. Acetaminophen (oral/intravenous) (15 mg/kg every 6 hours) for 3–7 days. 4. Intravenous indomethacin (0.1–0.3 mg/kg intravenous every 12–24 hours for a total of three doses). OUTCOMES: The primary outcome is failure of primary pharmacotherapy (defined as need for further medical and/or surgical/interventional treatment following an initial course of pharmacotherapy). The secondary outcomes include components of the primary outcome as well as clinical outcomes related to response to treatment or adverse effects of treatment. SITES AND SAMPLE SIZE: The study will be conducted in 22 NICUs across Canada with an anticipated enrollment of 1350 extremely preterm infants over 3 years. ANALYSIS: To examine the relative effectiveness of the four treatment strategies, the primary outcome will be compared pairwise between the treatment groups using χ(2) test. Secondary outcomes will be compared pairwise between the treatment groups using χ(2) test, Student’s t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum test as appropriate. To further examine differences in the primary and secondary outcomes between the four groups, multiple logistic or linear regression models will be applied for each outcome on the treatment groups, adjusted for potential confounders using generalised estimating equations to account for within-unit-clustering. As a sensitivity analysis, the difference in the primary and secondary outcomes between the treatment groups will also be examined using propensity score method with inverse probability weighting approach.

Outcomes have been poor, with reported admission rates to the intensive care team of 5% in China and mortality among critically ill patients of 50% in Seattle. Here we explore the disease characteristics in a Brooklyn safety-net hospital affected by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. Methods A retrospective chart review of COVID-19 positive patients at The Brooklyn Hospital Center who were treated by the intensive care team prior to April 20, 2020. Data was extracted from the electronic health record, analyzed and correlated for outcome. Results Impact of various clinical treatments was assessed, showing no change in median overall survival (OS) of both hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin or vitamin C with zinc. Supplemental therapies were used in selected patients, and some were shown to increase median OS and patients requiring vasopressor support or invasive mechanical ventilation showed decreased OS. There was no statistically significant difference in overall survival based on ethnicity, healthcare status, or individual medical comorbidities, although a negative trend exists for diabetes. Despite this, there is a trend towards increasingly poor prognosis based on the number of comorbidities and Class 3 obesity. Conclusions Despite the fact that we show no significant differences in mortality based on ethnicity, insurance status, or individual medical comorbidities, we show a high overall mortality. There is also a trend towards increased overall mortality in Class 3 obesity, which should be further investigated.

As a result, surgical care was restricted to urgent cases of surgery. However, the care for trauma patients is not suitable for reduction or delayed treatment. The influence of the pandemic on the burden of disease of trauma care remains to be elucidated. METHODS: All patients with traumatic injuries that were presented to the emergency departments (ED) of the Amsterdam University Medical Center, Location Academic Medical Center (AMC) and VU medical center (VUMC) and the Northwest Clinics (NWC) between March 10, 2019 and May 10, 2019 (non-COVID) and March 10, 2020 and May 10, 2020 (COVID-19 period) were included. The primary outcome was the difference in ED admissions for trauma patients between the non-COVID and COVID-19 study period. Additionally, patient- and injury characteristics, health care consumption, and 30-day mortality were evaluated. RESULTS: A 37% reduction of ED admissions for trauma patients was seen during the COVID-19 pandemic (non-COVID n = 2423 and COVID cohort n = 1531). Hospital admission was reduced by 1.6 trauma patients per day. Fewer patients sustained car- and sports-related injuries. Injuries after high energetic trauma were more severe in the COVID-19 period (Injury Severity Score 17.3 vs. 12.0, p = 0.006).

vo5e7qr6,,WHO,The Effect of Donor Graft Cryopreservation on Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Outcomes: A Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research Analysis. Implications during the COVID-19 Pandemic,,,,unk,"The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in the increased use of cryopreserved grafts for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). However, information about the effect of cryopreservation on outcomes for patients receiving allogeneic donor grafts is limited. We evaluated outcomes of HCT recipients who received either fresh or cryopreserved allogeneic bone marrow (BM) or peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) grafts reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research. A total of 7397 patients were included in the analysis. Recipients of cryopreserved graft were divided into 3 cohorts based on graft source: HLA-matched related PBSC donors (nâ¯=â¯1051), matched unrelated PBSC donors (nâ¯=â¯678), and matched related or unrelated BM donors (nâ¯=â¯154). These patients were propensity score matched with 5514 patients who received fresh allografts. The primary endpoint was engraftment. Multivariate analyses showed no significant increased risk of delayed engraftment, relapse, nonrelapse mortality (NRM), or survival with cryopreservation of BM grafts. In contrast, cryopreservation of related donor PBSC grafts was associated with decreased platelet recovery (hazard ratio [HR], 0.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.68 to 0.78; P < .001) and an increased risk of grade II-IV (HR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.48; Pâ¯=â¯.002) and grade III-IV (HR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.19 to 1.84; P < .001) acute graft-versus-host disease. Cryopreservation of unrelated PBSC grafts was associated with delayed engraftment of neutrophils (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.71 to 0.84; P < .001) and platelets (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.56 to 0.66; P < .001) as well as an increased risk of NRM (HR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.18 to 1.66; P < .001) and relapse (HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.11 to 1.58; Pâ¯=â¯.002) and decreased progression-free survival (HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.20 to 1.55; P < .001) and overall survival (OS) (HR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.22 to 1.58; P < .001). Reasons for cryopreservation were not routinely collected; however, in a subset of unrelated donor HCT recipients, the reason was typically a change in patient condition. Products cryopreserved for patient reasons were significantly associated with inferior OS in multivariate analysis (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.96; Pâ¯=â¯.029). We conclude that cryopreservation is associated with slower engraftment of PBSC grafts, which may be associated with inferior transplantation outcomes in some patient populations. However, the small numbers in the cryopreserved BM cohort and the lack of information on the reason for cryopreservation in all patients suggests that these data should be interpreted with caution, particularly in the context of the risks associated with unexpected loss of a graft during the pandemic.

Covid‐19 became a global pandemic, which led to a harmful impact on the world. Many predictive models of Covid‐19 are being proposed by academic researchers around the world to take the foremost decisions and enforce the appropriate control measures. Due to the lack of accurate Covid‐19 records and uncertainty, the standard techniques are being failed to correctly predict the epidemic global effects. To address this issue, we present an Artificial Intelligence (AI)‐based meta‐analysis to predict the trend of epidemic Covid‐19 over the world. The powerful machine learning algorithms namely Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Linear Regression were applied on real time‐series dataset, which holds the global record of confirmed, recovered, deaths and active cases of Covid‐19 outbreak. Statistical analysis has also been conducted to present various facts regarding Covid‐19 observed symptoms, a list of Top‐20 Coronavirus affected countries and a number of coactive cases over the world. Among the three machine learning techniques investigated, Naïve Bayes produced promising results to predict Covid‐19 future trends with less Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

As a central player in such critical cellular events, high-throughput screening (HTS) efforts targeting HYPE-mediated AMPylation warrant investigation. Herein, we present a dual HTS assay for the simultaneous identification of small-molecule activators and inhibitors of HYPE AMPylation. Employing the fluorescence polarization of an ATP analog fluorophore—Fl-ATP—we developed and optimized an efficient, robust assay that monitors HYPE autoAMPylation and is amenable to automated, high-throughput processing of diverse chemical libraries. Challenging our pilot screen with compounds from the LOPAC, Spectrum, MEGx, and NATx libraries yielded 0.3% and 1% hit rates for HYPE activators and inhibitors, respectively. Further, these hits were assessed for dose-dependency and validated via orthogonal biochemical AMPylation assays.

We developed a reproducible ecological niche modelling pipeline for bat hosts of SARS-like viruses (subgenus Sarbecovirus), given that since SARS-CoV-2 emergence several closely-related viruses have been discovered and sarbecovirus-host interactions have gained attention. We assess sampling biases and model bats current distributions based on climate and landscape relationships and project future scenarios.

Results indicated that inter-correlations between scores on all measures were significant and positive. Following the elimination of non-significant pathways, path analysis resulted in an adequately-fitting model in which the direct relationship between nature exposure and body appreciation was significant. In addition, connectedness to nature - but not trait mindfulness - significantly mediated the direct relationship.

METHODS: A nationally representative cross‐sectional telephone survey was conducted via a random multistage selection process in October 2019 in Greece. The survey was designed to obtain information about whether vaccination should be mandated or not among adults 18 years of age or older. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to estimate the association between individuals' sociodemographic, contextual and clinical characteristics, utilization, satisfaction, and trust in the healthcare system and providers and their preference over mandatory vaccination. RESULTS: A total of 901 participants fully completed the survey (response rate 90%‐901/1001). About 85% of the respondents supported mandatory vaccination. Individuals who used preventive services more often compared to those who never or rarely used such, those who reported increased trust in official healthcare authorities' guidelines and recommendations compared to those who reported no trust and those who had underage children living in the household were significantly more likely to support mandatory vaccination. No differences were observed for sociodemographic factors and mandatory vaccination support. CONCLUSION: This survey revealed that most Greek citizens support mandatory vaccination, which was critically affected by the utilization of preventive services and trust in healthcare authorities.

wf739dcr,,WHO,Incubation period of COVID-19: a rapid systematic review and meta-analysis of observational research,,,,unk,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to conduct a rapid systematic review and meta-analysis of estimates of the incubation period of COVID-19. DESIGN: Rapid systematic review and meta-analysis of observational research. SETTING: International studies on incubation period of COVID-19. PARTICIPANTS: Searches were carried out in PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase, Cochrane Library as well as the preprint servers MedRxiv and BioRxiv. Studies were selected for meta-analysis if they reported either the parameters and CIs of the distributions fit to the data, or sufficient information to facilitate calculation of those values. After initial eligibility screening, 24 studies were selected for initial review, nine of these were shortlisted for meta-analysis. Final estimates are from meta-analysis of eight studies. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Parameters of a lognormal distribution of incubation periods. RESULTS: The incubation period distribution may be modelled with a lognormal distribution with pooled mu and sigma parameters (95% CIs) of 1.63 (95% CI 1.51 to 1.75) and 0.50 (95% CI 0.46 to 0.55), respectively. The corresponding mean (95% CIs) was 5.8 (95% CI 5.0 to 6.7) days. It should be noted that uncertainty increases towards the tail of the distribution: the pooled parameter estimates (95% CIs) resulted in a median incubation period of 5.1 (95% CI 4.5 to 5.8) days, whereas the 95th percentile was 11.7 (95% CI 9.7 to 14.2) days. CONCLUSIONS: The choice of which parameter values are adopted will depend on how the information is used, the associated risks and the perceived consequences of decisions to be taken.

558tx95h,,PMC,Changes in Primary Care Telehealth Use and Impact on Acute Care Visits for Ambulatory Care‐Sensitive Conditions during COVID‐19,10.1111/1475-6773.13779,PMC8441483,,no-cc,"RESEARCH OBJECTIVE: The COVID‐19 pandemic forced a dramatic shift from in‐person care to telehealth, with an overall decrease in outpatient utilization. These changes particularly stressed outpatient care delivery and may have resulted in decreased availability and access to primary care for patients, potentially increasing otherwise avoidable emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations. One commonly used indicator of primary care access and quality is acute care visits for ambulatory care‐sensitive conditions (ACSCs), such as for pneumonia, uncontrolled diabetes, or congestive heart failure exacerbations. Our study examined differences in telehealth adoption across practices and evaluated the association between telehealth adoption and ACSC visits. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective study of claims data from a large commercial insurer in Michigan. We first profiled telehealth adoption by primary care practices during March–July 2020. We defined a practice's “telehealth conversion rate” as the proportion of visits conducted via telehealth during this period compared to the total number of visits during the same period in 2019. Then, to enable comparison between groups at a time when both outpatient and acute care visits were in flux, we used a differences‐in‐differences (DID) model to determine whether varying levels of primary care telehealth conversion were associated with differences in acute care visits (ED visits and hospitalizations) for ACSCs from June–September 2020. We examined visit rates for acute and chronic ACSCs separately, controlling for practice size, in‐person visit volume, and zip code‐level attributes as well as patient characteristics (age, gender, comorbidities). We performed sensitivity analyses using varying definitions of telemedicine conversion rates and multiple model specifications. POPULATION STUDIED: Six million Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan beneficiaries across 3780 primary care practices from January 2019 to September 2020. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Average primary care practice telehealth conversion rate was 25% (median 10%), and 29% of practices had no telehealth claims identified. Practices that did not adopt telehealth tended to be smaller and were more likely to be in rural areas. We found no significant differences in the rate of ED visits and hospitalizations for ACSCs by practice‐level telemedicine conversion tertile after adjusting for practice case‐mix, as shown in Table 1. Sensitivity analyses showed similar results. CONCLUSIONS: Beneficiaries within a large commercial payer experienced rapid shifts from in‐person to telehealth for their primary care, though telehealth adoption was not evenly distributed, with smaller and more rural practices being less likely to adopt telemedicine. These changes did not seem to obviously help or harm patients as ED visits and hospitalizations for ACSCs were similar across groups. IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY OR PRACTICE: Widespread substitution of telehealth for in‐person care had little impact on cost of care with respect to avoidable ED visits and hospitalizations in the near‐term. Additional research should continue to monitor this trend as health care utilization stabilizes beyond the pandemic.

9f6951ig,,WHO,SARS-CoV-2 analysis on environmental surfaces collected in an intensive care unit: keeping Ernest Shackleton's spirit,,,,unk,"BACKGROUND: Intensive care unit workers are at high risk of acquiring COVID-19 infection, especially when performing invasive techniques and certain procedures that generate aerosols (< 5 µm). Therefore, one of the objectives of the health systems should implement safety practices to minimize the risk of contagion among these health professionals. Monitoring environmental contamination of SARS-CoV-2 may help to determine the potential of the environment as a transmission medium in an area highly exposed to SARS-CoV-2, such as an intensive care unit. The objective of the study was to analyze the environmental contamination by SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces collected in an intensive care unit, which is dedicated exclusively to the care of patients with COVID-19 and equipped with negative pressure of - 10 Pa and an air change rate of 20 cycles per hour. Furthermore, all ICU workers were tested for COVID-19 by quantitative RT-PCR and ELISA methods. RESULTS: A total of 102 samples (72 collected with pre-moistened swabs used for collection of nasopharyngeal exudates and 30 with moistened wipes used in the environmental microbiological control of the food industry) were obtained from ventilators, monitors, perfusion pumps, bed rails, lab benches, containers of personal protective equipment, computer keyboards and mice, telephones, workers' shoes, floor, and other areas of close contact with COVID-19 patients and healthcare professionals who cared for them. The analysis by quantitative RT-PCR showed no detection of SARS-CoV-2 genome in environmental samples collected by any of the two methods described. Furthermore, none of the 237 ICU workers was infected by the virus. CONCLUSIONS: Presence of SARS-CoV-2 on the ICU surfaces could not be determined supporting that a strict cleaning protocol with sodium hypochlorite, a high air change rate, and a negative pressure in the ICU are effective in preventing environmental contamination.

Yet there is paucity of work regarding the end-of-life care (EOLC) for cancer patients dying with C-19. Methods: Retrospective record review of all non-ventilated patients who died in a tertiary referral UK cancer centre with known or suspected C-19 across the 2 peak pandemic waves from 25/03/20 – 01/05/20 and 05/12/20 – 01/03/21. Demographics and risk factors for severe C-19 were described. EOLC assessment considered palliative care (PC) needs, medications prescribed and advance care plans including Treatment Escalation Plans (TEP) and Do Not Attempt Resuscitation (DNAR) orders. Results: 34 patients were included. Most patients were female (18) and White British (19), mean age was 69 (45-82). 8 patients had recognised cardiovascular risk factors;11 patients had no comorbidities additional to cancer. 26 patient had metastatic disease, 30 were receiving palliative treatment. Most patients were referred to PC for symptom control (20), 8 were referred for EOLC. All patients had DNAR orders and TEPs. The median number of PC reviews was 5 (range 1-24). Integrated Palliative Outcome Scale (IPOS) (a holistic assessment tool used in clinical care) scores on first assessment (n=24) recorded the main symptoms as weakness, lacking peace and anxiety. Family anxiety was the highest scoring aspect. Medical management at the end-of-life was, however, generally uncomplicated;total opioid (oral morphine equivalent) and benzodiazepine doses administered in last 24 hours before death were relatively low, median dose (range) 30mg (5-180 mg) and 10mg (0-30mg) respectively. Conclusions: With prompt recognition and access to standard EOLC, the symptom management of cancer patients dying from C-19 is relatively uncomplicated. As a transmissible disease, associated with social anxiety and restrictions, death from C-19 is, however, undeniably complicated. Timely acknowledgment of the vulnerability of patients with advanced cancer and C-19 is essential to facilitate early communication about patients’ priorities and wishes, and enhance family support.

We describe a novel alternative to the EMS ride along experience more conducive to COVID-19 restrictions. Methods ?ED EMS Time? was developed as an alternative training method to provide a field-type experience within the emergency department (ED) setting. Over the course of a four hour shift, medical students observe and complete standardized reflections on Online Medical Control radio consultations and EMS to ED patient handoffs. Medical students also interview EMS clinicians to gain insight into prehospital care and the challenges that occur in the field. Experiences are debriefed with an EMS attending. Results Medical students expressed increased knowledge around the challenges and treatment capabilities of EMS through the ED EMS Time experience. They were able to explain what information obtained from the scene was helpful to EMS clinicians. Medical students were able to realize the objectives of ambulance ride time through an emergency department experience designed around EMS.

In a preclinical animal model of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in ovine fetuses, we have demonstrated the neuroprotective potential of systemically administered mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). The mechanism of MSC treatment is unclear but suggested to be paracrine, through secretion of extracellular vesicles (EVs). Therefore, we investigated in this study the protective effects of mesenchymal stromal cell-derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) in a preclinical model of preterm hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. Ovine fetuses were subjected to global hypoxia-ischemia by transient umbilical cord occlusion, followed by in utero intravenous administration of MSC-EVs. The therapeutic effects of MSC-EV administration were assessed by analysis of electrophysiological parameters and histology of the brain. Systemic administration of MSC-EVs improved brain function by reducing the total number and duration of seizures, and by preserving baroreceptor reflex sensitivity. These functional protections were accompanied by a tendency to prevent hypomyelination. Cerebral inflammation remained unaffected by the MSC-EV treatment. Our data demonstrate that MSC-EV treatment might provide a novel strategy to reduce the neurological sequelae following hypoxic-ischemic injury of the preterm brain. Our study results suggest that a cell-free preparation comprising neuroprotective MSC-EVs could substitute MSCs in the treatment of preterm neonates with hypoxic-ischemic brain injury, thereby circumventing the potential risks of systemic administration of living cells. SIGNIFICANCE Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) show promise in treating hypoxic-ischemic injury of the preterm brain. Study results suggest administration of extracellular vesicles, rather than intact MSCs, is sufficient to exert therapeutic effects and avoids potential concerns associated with administration of living cells. The therapeutic efficacy of systemically administered mesenchymal stromal cell-derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) on hypoxia-ischemia-induced injury was assessed in the preterm ovine brain. Impaired function and structural injury of the fetal brain was improved following global hypoxia-ischemia. A cell-free preparation of MSC-EVs could substitute for the cellular counterpart in the treatment of preterm neonates with hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. This may open new clinical applications for ""off-the-shelf"" interventions with MSC-EVs.",2016,"Ophelders, Daan R M G; Wolfs, Tim G A M; Jellema, Reint K; Zwanenburg, Alex; Andriessen, Peter; Delhaas, Tammo; Ludwig, Anna-Kristin; Radtke, Stefan; Peters, Vera; Janssen, Leon; Giebel, Bernd; Kramer, Boris W",Stem cells translational medicine,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.5966/sctm.2015-0197; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27160705/,915906.0

The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility of thermoplastic mask immobilization with a surgical mask using an ExacTrac system. Twelve patients each with brain metastases were immobilized using a thermoplastic mask and a surgical mask and only a thermoplastic mask. Two x-ray images were acquired to correct (XC) and verify (XV) the patient's position at a couch angle of 0°. Subsequently, the XC and XV images were acquired at each planned couch angle for non-coplanar beams. When the position errors were detected after couch rotation for non-coplanar beams, the errors were corrected at each planned couch angle until a clinically acceptable tolerance was attained. The position errors in the translational and rotational directions (vertical, lateral, longitudinal, pitch, roll, and yaw) were retrospectively investigated using data from the ExacTrac system database. A standard deviation of XC translational and rotational position errors with and without a surgical mask in the lateral (1.52 vs 2.07 mm), longitudinal (1.59 vs 1.87 mm), vertical (1.00 vs 1.73 mm), pitch (0.99 vs 0.79°), roll (1.24 vs 0.68°), and yaw (1.58 vs 0.90°) directions were observed at a couch angle of 0°.

SARS-CoV-2 infections were first detected in a Chinese Province in December 2019 and then declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. An infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 may result in asymptomatic, uncomplicated or fatal coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Fatal disease has been linked with the uncontrolled ""cytokine storm"" manifesting with complications mostly in people with underlying cardiovascular and pulmonary disease conditions. The severity of COVID-19 disease and the associated mortality has been disproportionately lower in terms of number of cases and deaths in Africa and also Asia in comparison to Europe and North America. Also, persons of colour residing in Europe and North America have been identified as a highly susceptible population due to a combination of several socioeconomic factors and poor access to quality healthcare. Interestingly, this has not been the case in sub-Saharan Africa where majority of the population are even more deprived of the aforementioned factors. On the contrary, sub-Saharan Africa has recorded the lowest levels of mortality and morbidity associated with the disease, and an overwhelming proportion of infections are asymptomatic. Whilst it can be argued that these lower number of cases in Africa may be due to challenges associated with the diagnosis of the disease such as lack of trained personnel and infrastructure, the number of persons who get infected and develop symptoms is proportionally lower than those who are asymptomatic, including asymptomatic cases that are never diagnosed.

Therefore, we explored real-world effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination on subsequent infection in IBD patients with diverse exposure to immunosuppressive medications. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study of patients in the Veterans Health Administration with IBD diagnosed prior to 12/18/20, the start date of the VHA patient vaccination program. IBD medication exposures included 5-aminosalicylic acid, thiopurines, anti-tumor necrosis factor biologic agents, vedolizumab, ustekinumab, tofacitinib, methotrexate, and corticosteroid use. We used inverse probability weighting and Cox regression with vaccination status as a time-updating exposure, and computed vaccine effectiveness from incidence rates. Results The cohort comprised 14,697 patients, 7,321 of whom received at least one vaccine dose (45.2% Pfizer, 54.8% Moderna). The cohort had median age 68 years, was 92.2% male, 80.4% white, and 61.8% with ulcerative colitis. In follow-up data through April 20, 2021, unvaccinated individuals had the highest raw proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infection (197 [1.34%] versus 7 [0.11%] fully vaccinated).

suudcsqu,,WHO,Tocilizumab in severe COVID-19 disease: Does timing matters?,,,,unk,"Rationale: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected nearly every country, becoming a global health problem with social and economic consequences for years to come. To date, there are several agents under active investigation as potential treatments, among them is the interleukin-6 receptor blocker tocilizumab. Early observational studies have identified an association between the use of tocilizumab and a decreased risk of intubation and/or death, however randomized clinical trials have not found a significant benefit yet. The aim of our study was to assess whether the timing of tocilizumab influenced the outcome of patients with severe COVID-19. Methods: This is a retrospective observational study involving 56 Ecuadorian patients treated with corticosteroids plus tocilizumab after a confirmed diagnosis of severe COVID-19 respiratory disease in the context of a hyperinflammatory state. A hyperinflammatory state was defined by the SIRS criteria plus at least 1 of the following three: i.) CRP &gt;100 mg/L, ii.) serum ferritin &gt;900 μg/L on one occasion or a twofold increase of the level at admission within 48 hours;or iii.) D-dimer level &gt;1500 μg/L. Descriptive statistics were reported. A point-biserial correlation was conducted to assess the relationship between symptomatic days prior treatment with survival status. Furthermore, a chi-square test for association was performed between corticosteroids/tocilizumab dosage and survival status. All the data was analyzed using SPSS, version 24.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). For all test a p-value of less than 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. Results: The sample mean age was 61.7 (SD 10.9) years with a 7:3 male/female ratio. 76.8% (n=43) patients survived with a mean time to hospital discharge of 11.5 days (SD 12.0). Regarding treatment, average days prior to corticosteroids administration was 2.6 (SD 2.5), while 11.1 (SD 9.0) was for tocilizumab. A statistically significant negative correlation between days prior tocilizumab administration and survival status was reported (rpb =-.290, n = 56, p = .030) (Figure 1). On the other hand, no significant association between tocilizumab dosage and survival status was determined (χ2 (5) = 3.566, p = .600). Same analyses with corticosteroids yielded non-significant results. Conclusion: Early administration of tocilizumab was associated with a greater likelihood of surviving, an observation that could not be reproduced with corticosteroids. The association between tocilizumab dosage and survival status, however, was not statistically significant. Further large-scale studies are needed to confirm the exact role of the timing of tocilizumab in patients with severe COVID-19.

It is mainly manifested as pneumonia which may deteriorate into severe respiratory failure. The major hallmark of the disease is the systemic inflammatory immune response characterized by Cytokine Storm (CS). CS is marked by elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines, mainly interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, IL-10, tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ). Of these, IL-6 is found to be significantly associated with higher mortality. IL-6 is also a robust marker for predicting disease prognosis and deterioration of clinical profile. In this review, the pivotal role played by IL-6 in the immuno-pathology of COVID-19 has been illustrated. The role of IL-6 as a pleiotropic cytokine executing both pro and anti-inflammatory activities has been reviewed. ADAM 10, a metalloproteinase switches the anti-inflammatory pathway of IL-6 to pro inflammatory hence blocking the action of ADAM 10 could be a new therapeutic strategy to mitigate the proinflammatory action of IL-6.

vgo6c7ib,,WHO,Smart healthcare support for remote patient monitoring during covid-19 quarantine,,,,unk,"Social distancing and quarantining are now standard practices which are implemented worldwide since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) disease pandemic in 2019. Due to the full acceptance of the above control practices, frequent hospital contact visits are being discouraged. However, there are people whose physiological vital needs still require routine monitoring for improved healthy living. Interestingly, with the recent technological advancements in the areas of Internet of Things (IoT) technology, smart home automation, and healthcare systems, contact-based hospital visits are now regarded as non-obligatory. To this end, a remote smart home healthcare support system (ShHeS) is proposed for monitoring patients' health status and receiving doctors' prescriptions while staying at home. Besides this, doctors can also carry out the diagnosis of ailments using the data collected remotely from the patient. An android based mobile application that interfaces with a web-based application is implemented for efficient patients-doctors dual real-time communication. Sensors are incorporated in the system for automatic capturing of physiological health parameters of patients. Also, a hyperspace analogue to context (HAC) was incorporated into the current monitoring framework for service discovery and context change in the home environment towards accurate readings of the physiological parameters and improved system performance. With the proposed system, patients can be remotely monitored from their homes, and can also live a more comfortable life through the use of some features of smart home automation devices on their phones. Therefore, one main significant contribution of this study is that patients in self-isolation or self-quarantine can use the new platform to send daily health symptoms and challenges to doctors via their mobile phones. Thus, improved healthy living and a comfortable lifestyle can still be achieved even during such a problematic period of the 2019 COVID-19 pandemic that has already recorded 20,026,186 million cases so far with 734,020 thousand deaths globally.",2020,"Taiwo, Olutosin; Ezugwu, Absalom E",Inform Med Unlocked,,#758930,,,,,221666403.0

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective, multi-center cohort study of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Multivariate competing risk models were employed to explore the rate of reintubation and its determining factors. RESULTS: Two hundred eighty-one extubated patients were included (mean age, 61.0 years [±13.9]; 54.8% male). Reintubation occurred in 93 (33.1%). In multivariate analysis accounting for death, reintubation risk increased with age (hazard ratio [HR] 1.04 per 1-year increase, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02 -1.06), vasopressors (HR 1.84, 95% CI 1.04-3.60), renal replacement (HR 2.01, 95% CI 1.22-3.29), maximum PEEP (HR 1.07 per 1-unit increase, 95% CI 1.02 -1.12), paralytics (HR 1.48, 95% CI 1.08-2.25) and requiring more than nasal cannula immediately post-extubation (HR 2.19, 95% CI 1.37-3.50). Reintubation was associated with higher mortality (36.6% vs 2.1%; P < 0.0001) and risk of inpatient death after adjusting for multiple factors (HR 23.2, 95% CI 6.45-83.33).

Seven respiratory RNA viruses and three subtypes of Influenza A virus had been used to test capabilities of CATCH on detection and quantification. Analytical performance of SARS CoV 2 and Influenza A virus had been determined with reference standards. We compared accuracy of CATCH with quantitative real time PCR by using clinical 98 samples from 64 COVID19 patients. Results: We minimized the library preparation process to 3 hours and handling time to 35 minutes. Duplicate filtered RPM of 7 respiratory viruses and 3 Influenza A virus subtypes were highly correlated with viral concentration.

6gdrkeeh,,WHO,Biological Aging Predicts Vulnerability to COVID-19 Severity in UK Biobank Participants,,,,unk,"BACKGROUND: Age and disease prevalence are the two biggest risk factors for COVID-19 symptom severity and death. We therefore hypothesized that increased biological age, beyond chronological age, may be driving disease-related trends in COVID-19 severity. METHODS: Using the UK Biobank England data, we tested whether a biological age estimate (PhenoAge) measured more than a decade prior to the COVID-19 pandemic was predictive of two COVID-19 severity outcomes (inpatient test positivity and COVID-19 related mortality with inpatient test-confirmed COVID-19). Logistic regression models were used with adjustment for age at the pandemic, sex, ethnicity, baseline assessment centers, and pre-existing diseases/conditions. RESULTS: 613 participants tested positive at inpatient settings between March 16 and April 27, 2020, 154 of whom succumbed to COVID-19. PhenoAge was associated with increased risks of inpatient test positivity and COVID-19 related mortality (ORMortality=1.63 per 5 years, 95% CI: 1.43-1.86, p=4.7×10 -13) adjusting for demographics including age at the pandemic. Further adjustment for pre-existing disease s/conditions at baseline (ORM=1.50, 95% CI: 1.30-1.73 per 5 years, p=3.1×10 -8) and at the early pandemic (ORM=1.21, 95% CI: 1.04-1.40 per 5 years, p=0.011) decreased the association. CONCLUSIONS: PhenoAge measured in 2006-2010 was associated with COVID-19 severity outcomes more than 10 years later. These associations were partly accounted for by prevalent chronic diseases proximate to COVID-19 infection. Overall, our results suggest that aging biomarkers, like PhenoAge may capture long-term vulnerability to diseases like COVID-19, even before the accumulation of age-related comorbid conditions.",2021,"Kuo, Chia-Ling; Pilling, Luke C; Atkins, Janice L; Masoli, Jane A H; Delgado, João; Tignanelli, Christopher; Kuchel, George A; Melzer, David; Beckman, Kenneth B; Levine, Morgan E","J. gerontol.

The labor market is one affected sector marked with a high rate of layoffs. One of the government’s efforts to overcome this phenomenon is by adopting a job loss insurance scheme. This research discusses the background of the job loss insurance regulation and system in Indonesia and how job loss insurance could overcome the impact of layoffs due to economic recession. The method used in this research is normative juridical legal research. In analyzing legal materials, this research uses qualitative descriptive analysis. Job loss insurance is an assurance provided to those who were affected. When workers experience layoffs, they will receive benefits of cash, access to market information, and job training. It was found that a job loss insurance scheme could accelerate former workers to find permanent employment and prevent them from losing their motivation to seek a job. Studies on the implementation of job loss insurance in other countries show that the job loss insurance scheme effectively reduces unemployment numbers, especially during the time of economic recession. As a suggestion from this research, the job loss insurance needs to be socialized, and the job training needs to be adjusted to market demand to fully benefit the workers. Pandemi COVID-19 menyebabkan pertumbuhan perekonomian dunia mengalami resesi tajam yaitu kisaran 4,4%-5,2%. Pasar kerja menjadi salah satu sektor yang terdampak ditandai dengan tingginya angka pemutusan hubungan kerja (PHK). Salah satu upaya pemerintah untuk mengatasi gejala ini adalah dengan pengadopsian skema jaminan kehilangan pekerjaan. Artikel ini membahas latar belakang diadakannya jaminan kehilangan pekerjaan serta sistemnya di Indonesia dan cara skema jaminan kehilangan pekerjaan dapat menanggulangi dampak pemutusan hubungan kerja akibat resesi ekonomi. Metode penelitian yang digunakan adalah penelitian hukum yuridis normatif. Dalam menganalisis bahan hukum, penelitian ini menggunakan analisis deskriptif kualitatif. Jaminan kehilangan pekerjaan merupakan bentuk jaminan sosial yang diberikan kepada pekerja yang mengalami pemutusan hubungan kerja. Apabila pekerja mengalami PHK, pekerja akan menerima manfaat berupa uang tunai, akses informasi pasar kerja, dan pelatihan kerja. Ditemukan bahwa skema jaminan kehilangan pekerjaan dapat mempercepat eks pekerja mendapatkan pekerjaan permanen dan mencegah eks pekerja kehilangan motivasinya untuk mencari kerja. Studi pelaksanaan unemployment insurance di negara lain menunjukkan bahwa skema unemployment insurance efektif dalam mengatasi jumlah pengangguran, khususnya dalam masa resesi ekonomi. Sebagai saran dari penelitian ini, skema jaminan kehilangan pekerjaan perlu disosialisasikan dan pelatihan kerjanya disesuaikan dengan permintaan pasar agar benar-benar memberikan manfaatnya.",2021,"Wiryadi Kania, Jennifer Novendra Bayu",Negara Hukum: Membangun Hukum untuk Keadilan dan Kesejahteraan,,#covidwho-1647194,,,,,237856506.0

METHODS: We conduct data-driven and model-free estimations for the growth rates of the COVID-19 epidemics in Italy and Canada, by fitting an exponential curve to the daily reported cases. We use these estimates to predict epidemic trends in Canada under different scenarios of public health interventions. RESULTS: In Italy, the initial growth rate (0.22) has reduced to 0.1 two weeks after the lockdown of the country on March 8th(,) 2020. This corresponds to an increase of the doubling time from about 3.15 to almost 7 days. In comparison, the growth rate in Canada has increased from 0.13 between March 1st and 13th, to 0.25 between March 13th to 22nd. This current growth rate corresponds to a doubling time of 2.7 days, and therefore, unless further public health interventions are escalated in Canada, we project 15,000 cases by March 31st. However, the case number may be reduced to 4000 if escalated public health interventions could instantly reduce the growth rate to 0.1, the same level achieved in Italy. INTERPRETATION: Prompt and farsighted interventions are critical to counteract the very rapid initial growth of the COVID-19 epidemic in Canada.

Fracture neck of femur or intertrochanteric fracture either isolated or in combination such as simultaneous bilateral fracture neck of femur and simultaneous bilateral intertrochanteric fractures are relatively commonly reported in literature. Herein, we report a very rare case of a young female with chronic kidney disease who presented with simultaneous fractures neck of femur on the one side and contralateral intertrochanteric fracture of femur after a fall from standing height. CASE REPORT: A 41-year-old female with chronic kidney disease from the past 5 years presented to us with severe pain at both hip and inability to stand after a fall from standing height. Clinical examination and investigations were done. She suffered fracture neck of femur on the right side and intertrochanteric fracture femur on the left side. Single stage fixation of both these fractures by two different methods was done successfully after optimization of her medical condition with multidisciplinary approach. She was advised weight bearing according to fixation method used and progress of fracture union. She regained her preoperative walking status gradually in 6 months. CONCLUSION: Simultaneous fractures in the neck of femur on the one side and intertrochanteric fracture of the femur on the other side are very rare presentation and can happen in patients with primary or secondary bone disease.

The goal of this study was to develop a short Chinese version of the STAI and examine its reliability and validity among the general Chinese population and psychiatric patients diagnosed with anxiety. METHOD: A total of 1,142 participants were invited to test the short Chinese version of the STAI; item analysis, validity testing and internal consistency reliability analysis were performed. Subsequently, 40 participants were enrolled to assess retest reliability 1 week later. Finally, 330 participants, including 33 psychiatric patients with anxiety, were used to assess the criterion and empirical validity. The Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) were used as criteria, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was conducted to evaluate the discrimination of the short version of the STAI between the groups with and without anxiety disorders. RESULT: The short Chinese version of the STAI contains six items for each subscale (STAI-S-6 and STAI-T-6). The Pearson correlation coefficients between the two shortened Chinese versions of the STAI and the full-length STAI were 0.970 and 0.962, the Cronbach’s α coefficients were 0.871 and 0.842, and the retest reliability values were 0.728 and 0.813 (p < 0.001). Confirmatory factor analysis showed that the 2-factor model achieved an adequate model fit: for the STAI-S-6, CFI = 0.986, TLI = 0.974, and RMSEA = 0.075, and for the STAI-T-6, CFI = 0.994, TLI = 0.988, and RMSEA = 0.052.

An effective preventive vaccine against this virus is urgently needed. As an essential step during infection, SARS-CoV-2 uses the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein to engage with the receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on host cells1,2. Here we show that a recombinant vaccine that comprises residues 319-545 of the RBD of the spike protein induces a potent functional antibody response in immunized mice, rabbits and non-human primates (Macaca mulatta) as early as 7 or 14 days after the injection of a single vaccine dose. The sera from the immunized animals blocked the binding of the RBD to ACE2, which is expressed on the cell surface, and neutralized infection with a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and live SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Notably, vaccination also provided protection in non-human primates to an in vivo challenge with SARS-CoV-2. We found increased levels of RBD-specific antibodies in the sera of patients with COVID-19. We show that several immune pathways and CD4 T lymphocytes are involved in the induction of the vaccine antibody response.

The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (S-protein), which consists of trimeric polypeptide chains with glycosylated residues on the surface, triggers the virus entry into a host cell. Extensive structural and functional studies on this protein have rapidly advanced our understanding of the S-protein structure at atomic resolutions, while most of structural studies overlook the effect of glycans attached to S-protein on the conformational stability and functional motions between the inactive Down and the active Up forms. Here, we performed all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of both Down and Up forms of a fully glycosylated S-protein in solution as well as targeted MD (TMD) simulations between them to elucidate key inter-domain interactions for stabilizing each form and inducing the large-scale conformational transitions. The residue-level interaction analysis of the simulation trajectories detects distinct amino-acid residues and N-glycans as determinants on conformational stability of each form. During the conformational transitions between them, inter-domain interactions mediated by glycosylated residues are switched to play key roles on the stabilization of another form. Electrostatic interactions as well as hydrogen bonds between the three receptor binding domains work as driving forces to initiate the conformational transitions toward the active form.

We sought to examine the acceptability of the shorter version of the KCCQ (KCCQ-12) among racially and ethnically diverse patients receiving care in an urban, safety-net setting. METHODS: We conducted cognitive interviews with a diverse population of patients with heart failure in a safety net system to assess their perceptions of the KCCQ-12. We conducted a thematic analysis of the qualitative data then mapped themes to the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation Model of Behavior framework. RESULTS: We interviewed 18 patients with heart failure and found that patients broadly endorsed the concepts of the KCCQ-12 with minor suggestions to improve the instrument’s content and appearance. Although patients accepted the KCCQ-12, we found that the instrument did not adequately measure aspects of health care and quality of life that patients identified as being important components of managing their heart failure. Patient-important factors of heart failure management coalesced into three main themes: social support, health care environment, and mental health. CONCLUSIONS: Patients from this diverse, low-income, majority non-white population experience unique challenges and circumstances that impact their ability to manage disease. In this study, patients were receptive to the KCCQ-12 as a tool but perceived that it did not adequately capture key health components such as mental health and social relationships that deeply impact their ability to manage HF. Further study on the incorporation of social determinants of health into PROMs could make them more useful tools in evaluating and managing HF in diverse, underserved populations.

We report on two such patients with associated adrenal involvement, which is now being recognised. Both patients presented with abdominal pain, back pain and vomiting. Case 1 was a 46-year-old male who had received the first dose of the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccination 8 days earlier. Imaging demonstrated a number of serious thrombotic complications including evolving bilateral adrenal haemorrhage (right adrenal haemorrhage identified at presentation, with the left-sided changes only evident on day 4 of the admission). Case 2 was a 38-year-old female who had received the first dose of Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccination 11 days prior. Imaging demonstrated left renal vein thrombosis and left adrenal infarction. VITT was diagnosed in both cases given these changes and other consistent haematological findings. Both patients were treated empirically for adrenal insufficiency, a diagnosis subsequently confirmed in case 1. We report these two cases of VITT presenting with adrenal complications (haemorrhage and infarction) after Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccination to highlight the association and the need for prompt management of co-existing adrenal insufficiency, especially given the potential for evolving adrenal involvement. Learning points Adrenal complications (thrombosis/infarction/haemorrhage) may develop as a part of vaccine-induced immune thrombocytopenia (VITT) after SARS-CoV-2 Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccination. Evolving adrenal involvement is possible and ongoing assessment is required to identify this promptly. Cortisol levels may be difficult to interpret when assessing for adrenal insufficiency, given high doses of corticosteroids may be used to manage VITT. Clinicians should have a low threshold for starting empirical replacement with corticosteroids until reliable assessment of adrenal function can be performed.",2022,"Graf, Anneke Armeni Eleni Dickinson Louise Stubbs Matthew Craven Brian Srirangalingam Umasuthan Chung Teng-Teng","Endocrinology, diabetes & metabolism case reports",,#covidwho-1695997,,,,,246759823.0

Although infective pathogens have been extensively studied, a significant proportion of illnesses (over 40%) have been due to unknown causative agents. Other health hazards, which can lead to respiratory illnesses among troops, are extreme air temperatures, desert dust, emissions from burn pits, industrial pollutants, and airborne contaminants originating from degraded soil.

However, as asymptomatic cases are common and there have been limitations of health care systems for COVID-19 microbiological diagnosis, these estimations may be misleading. The availability of reliable serology for the diagnosis of COVID-19 may overcome this drawback. This study was carried out in order to reveal the actual incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in PLWH in Southern Spain. Methods: This is a prospective cohort study including HIV infected patients from the Unit of Infectious Diseases of a university hospital in Seville, Southern Spain. Patients were enrolled in the study if 1) they had attended the outpatient clinic from September 1 st to December 31 st , 2019 (baseline), and 2) had a subsequent evaluation from March 1 st to June 30 th , 2020 (intra-pandemic). Serum antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were determined in baseline and intra-pandemic samples. Results: 326 patients were included in the study. Of them, 4 (1.25% [95% CI: 0.3%-3.1%]) developed COVID-19. One patient developed bilateral pneumonia and died. The remaining three showed mild respiratory symptoms suggesting COVID-19. No asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection was observed in this study. No patient with COVID-19 was tobacco smoker. The incidence of COVID-19 among non-smokers was 2.5% (95% CI [0.6%-6%], p=0.057 versus smokers). Conclusions: The incidence of COVID-19 among PLWH in our area was low and similar to that observed in the general population. The frequency of asymptomatic cases might be lower than in patients without HIV infection.

wwko68g2,,WHO,Methylene blue photochemical treatment as a reliable SARS-CoV-2 plasma virus inactivation method for blood safety and convalescent plasma therapy for COVID-19,,,,unk,"BACKGROUND: In 2020, a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, quickly spread worldwide within a few months. Although coronaviruses typically infect the upper or lower respiratory tract, the virus RNA can be detected in plasma. The risk of transmitting coronavirus via transfusion of blood products remains. As more asymptomatic infections are identified in COVID-19 cases, blood safety has become particularly important. Methylene blue (MB) photochemical technology has been proven to inactivate lipid-enveloped viruses with high efficiency and safety. The present study aimed to investigate the SARS-CoV-2 inactivation effects of MB in plasma. METHODS: The SARS-CoV-2 virus strain was isolated from Zhejiang University. The live virus was harvested from cultured VERO-E6 cells, and mixed with MB in plasma. The MB final concentrations were 0, 1, 2, and 4 µM. The ""BX-1 AIDS treatment instrument"" was used at room temperature, the illumination adjusted to 55,000 ± 0.5 million Lux, and the plasma was irradiated for 0, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 40 mins using light at a single wavelength of 630 nm. Virus load changes were measured using quantitative reverse transcription- PCR. RESULTS: BX-1 could effectively eliminate SARS-CoV-2 within 2 mins in plasma, and the virus titer declined to 4.5 log10 TCID50 (median tissue culture infectious dose)/mL. CONCLUSION: BX-1 is based on MB photochemical technology, which was designed to inactivate HIV-1 virus in plasma. It was proven to be safe and reliable in clinical trials of HIV treatment. In this study, we showed that BX-1 could also be applied to inactivate SARS-CoV-2. During the current outbreak, this technique it has great potential for ensuring the safety of blood transfusions, for plasma transfusion therapy in recovering patients, and for preparing inactivated vaccines.",2021,"Jin, Changzhong; Yu, Bin; Zhang, Jie; Wu, Hao; Zhou, Xipeng; Yao, Hangping; Liu, Fumin; Lu, Xiangyun; Cheng, Linfang; Jiang, Miao; Wu, Nanping",BMC Infect Dis,,#covidwho-1190056,,,,,233247421.0

During the time window before the COVID-19 critical peak and particularly thereafter, as hospitals are able to resume cancer operations, we anticipate that there will be great need to maximize efficiency to treat breast cancer. The goal of this study is to present a same-day protocol that minimizes resource utilization to enable hospitals to increase inpatient capacity, while providing care for breast cancer patients undergoing mastectomy and immediate breast reconstruction during the COVID-19 crisis. METHODS: IRB exempt patient quality improvement initiative was conducted to detail the operationalization of a novel same-day breast reconstruction protocol. Consecutive patients having undergone immediate breast reconstruction were prospectively enrolled between February and March of 2020 at Massachusetts General Hospital during the COVID-19 crisis. Peri-operative results and postoperative complications were summarized. RESULTS: Time interval from surgical closure to patient discharge was 5.02 ± 1.29 h. All patients were discharged home, with no re-admissions or emergency department visits. No postoperative complications were observed. CONCLUSION: This report provides an instruction manual to operationalize a same-day breast reconstruction protocol, to meet demands of providing appropriate cancer treatment during times of unprecedented resource limitations.

The health system was rapidly overwhelmed by the pandemic. It became evident that patients suffering from timesensitive medical emergencies like stroke, cerebral hemorrhage, trauma and acute myocardial infarction required timely, effective and safe pathways to be treated. The problem was addressed by a regional decree that created a hub-and-spoke system for time-sensitive medical emergencies. METHODS: We report the re-organizational changes adopted at a hub hospital (despite having already destined to COVID-19 patients most resources), and the number of emergent procedures for medical emergencies on the first 30-day of activity. These data were compared with the hospital activity in the same period of the previous year. RESULTS: Organizational changes were implemented in few hours. Dedicated pathways for non-COVID-19 patients affected by a medical emergency were set up in the emergency department, in the labs and in the operating theater. Ten intensive beds were implemented from a high-dependency unit; two operating rooms were reserved 24h/day to neurosurgical or trauma emergencies.

The article concludes that the poor outlook for the Brazilian economy relates to both the resumption of orthodox policies and the unleashing of a second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, both contributing to a slow recovery of the Brazilian economy.",2021,"de Paula, L.

The primary aim of this study was to analyze the prognostic significance of low muscle mass using computed tomography (CT) scans in COVID-19 critically ill patients. A second objective was to determine the accuracy and agreement in low muscle mass identification using diverse markers compared to CT as the gold standard. Methods This was a prospective cohort study of COVID-19 critically ill patients. Skeletal muscle area at the third lumbar vertebra was measured. Clinical outcomes (intensive care unit [ICU] and hospital length of stay [LOS], tracheostomy, days on mechanical ventilation [MV], and in-hospital mortality) were assessed. Phase angle, estimated fat-free mass index, calf circumference, and mid-upper arm circumference were measured as surrogate markers of muscle mass. Results Eighty-six patients were included (mean age ± SD: 48.6 ± 12.9; 74% males). Patients with low muscle mass (48%) had a higher rate of tracheostomy (50 vs 20%, p=0.01), prolonged ICU (adjusted HR 0.53, 95%CI 0.30-0.92, p=0.024) and hospital LOS (adjusted HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.29-0.86, p=0.014). Bedside markers of muscle mass showed poor to fair agreement and accuracy compared to CT-assessed low muscle mass. Conclusion Low muscle mass at admission was associated with prolonged length of ICU and hospital stays.

In an attempt to improve the yield of close contact collection, the Fulton County Board of Health implemented a pilot approach to contact elicitation at the time of testing. METHODS: Between October and November 2020, close contacts were elicited from persons under investigation (PUIs) at one COVID-19 testing site in Fulton County, GA. Secure online data collection forms were used to record PUI demographic data, close contact information and reasons for not providing contacts. RESULTS: Of 1238 PUIs, 48% reported at least one contact. Among the 66 people who tested positive, 16 (24%) reported contacts compared to 578/1165 (50%) who tested negative. PUIs of increasing age were less likely to provide contacts; Black and Hispanic PUIs were also less likely to report any contacts compared to White and Asian PUIs. CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed that PUIs testing positive were less likely to provide contacts compared to PUIs testing negative. Age and racial differences were also noted in the provision of contacts.

The purpose of this study was to examine the psychometric properties of the Turkish version of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) and to analyze the validity and reliability in children and adolescents. Method: The study sample consisted of 381 children aged 10-18 years. Cronbach's alpha internal consistency analysis was used to evaluate the scale's reliability, and the criterion validity was assessed with the Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale- Child (RCADS-C) subscale scores. The construct validity of the scale was examined using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. Results: The Cronbach's alpha internal consistency coefficient calculated to determine the scale's reliability was alpha=0.88. The corrected total item test correlation values of the items varied between 0.63 and 0.68. Exploratory factor analysis determined that the factor load of the scale items was 0.73-0.77 and that there was only one factor with an eigenvalue >1. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated that the fit indices were acceptable. Conclusion: These findings show that the Turkish version of the FCV-19S is a valid and reliable measurement tool for use with children and adolescents.

In mmWBat, we show that the micromotions can be measured via the interferometric phase evolution tracking from range-angle joint dimension, integrating with full-field localization and tricky clutter elimination. With our approach, we demonstrate the capacity to solve challenges in three disparate applications: multiperson vital sign monitoring, full-field mechanical vibration measurement, and multiple sound source localization and reconstruction (radiofrequency microphone).

Providing interventions, as part of transitional care, that optimize the functioning of older people with dementia is critical due to the small window of opportunity in which they can return to their baseline levels of functioning. Yet prior research on transitional care has not included interventions focused on functioning and did not target older people with dementia in rural communities, limiting the applicability of transitional care to this population. Accordingly, the goal of this study is to align hospital-to-home transitional care with the function-related needs of older people with dementia and their family-caregivers in rural communities. METHODS: In this multimethod study, two phases of activities are planned in rural Ontario and Nova Scotia. In phase I, a purposive sample of 15–20 people with dementia and 15–20 family-caregivers in each province will rate the acceptability of six evidence-based interventions and participate in semi-structured interviews to explore the interventions’ acceptability and, where relevant, how to improve their acceptability. Acceptable interventions will be further examined in phase II, in which a purposive sample of healthcare providers, stratified by employment location (hospital vs. homecare) and role (clinician vs. decision-maker), will (1) rate the acceptability of the interventions and (2) participate in semi-structured focus group discussions on the facilitators and barriers to delivering the interventions, and suggestions to enable their incorporation into rural transitional care. Two to three focus groups per stratum (8–10 healthcare providers per focus group) will be held for a total of 8–12 focus groups per province. Data analysis will involve qualitative content analysis of interview and focus group discussions and descriptive statistics of intervention acceptability ratings. DISCUSSION: Findings will (1) include a set of acceptable interventions for rural transitional care that promote older patients’ functioning and family-caregivers’ ability to support patients’ functioning, (2) identify resources needed to incorporate the interventions into rural transitional care, and (3) provide high-quality evidence to inform new transitional care practices and policies and guide future research.",2021-07-22,"Fox, Mary T.; Sidani, Souraya; Butler, Jeffrey I.; Skinner, Mark W.; Macdonald, Marilyn; Durocher, Evelyne; Hunter, Kathleen F.; Wagg, Adrian; Weeks, Lori E.; MacLeod, Ann; Dahlke, Sherry",Implement Sci Commun,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/4afcb7b34dad3006498978acaae39b83df41d78b.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8295643.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34294145/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s43058-021-00179-w,236163393.0

yzf40cuh,,WHO,Innovative approach to fast electron microscopy using the example of a culture of virus‐infected cells: An application to sars‐cov‐2,,,,unk,"Despite the development of new diagnostic methods, co‐culture, based on sample inoc-ulation of cell monolayers coupled with electron microscopy (EM) observation, remains the gold standard in virology. Indeed, co‐culture allows for the study of cell morphology (infected and not infected), the ultrastructure of the inoculated virus, and the different steps of the virus infectious cycle. Most EM methods for studying virus cycles are applied after infected cells are produced in large quantities and detached to obtain a pellet. Here, cell culture was performed in sterilized, collagen‐coated single‐break strip wells. After one day in culture, cells were infected with SARS‐CoV‐2. Wells of interest were fixed at different time points, from 2 to 36 h post‐infection. Microwave‐assisted resin embedding was accomplished directly in the wells in 4 h. Finally, ul-tra‐thin sections were cut directly through the infected‐cell monolayers. Our methodology re-quires, in total, less than four days for preparing and observing cells. Furthermore, by observing undetached infected cell monolayers, we were able to observe new ultrastructural findings, such as cell–cell interactions and baso‐apical cellular organization related to the virus infectious cycle. Our innovative methodology thus not only saves time for preparation but also adds precision and new knowledge about viral infection, as shown here for SARS‐CoV‐2. © 2021 by the authors.

Chest CT findings have the potential to guide management in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Objective. To explore a CT visual severity score in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, with attention to temporal changes in the score and the role of the score in a model for predicting in-hospital complications. Methods. This retrospective study included 161 inpatients with COVID-19 from three hospitals in China who underwent serial chest CT scans during hospitalization. CT examinations were evaluated using a visual severity scoring system. The temporal pattern of the CT visual severity score across serial CT examinations during hospitalization was characterized using a generalized spline regression model. A prognostic model to predict major complications, including in-hospital mortality, was created using the CT visual severity score and clinical variables. External model validation was performed in a cohort of 135 patients from a different hospital, evaluated by two independent radiologists. Results. The cohort included 91 survivors with non-severe disease, 55 survivors with severe disease, and 15 patients who died during hospitalization. Median CT visual lung severity score in the first week of hospitalization was 2.0 in survivors with non-severe disease, 4.0 in survivors with severe disease, and 11.0 in non-survivors. CT visual severity score peaked on hospitalization day 9 and 12 in survivors with non-severe and severe disease, respectively, and progressively decreased in subsequent hospitalization weeks in both groups. In the prognostic model, in-hospital complications were independently associated with a severe CT score (odds ratio [OR] 31.28), moderate CT score (OR 5.86), age (OR 1.09 per year increase), and lymphocyte count (OR 0.03 per 1*10^9/L increase). In the validation cohort, the two readers achieved C-index of 0.92-0.95, accuracy 85.2%-86.7%, sensitivity 70.7%-75.6%, and specificity 91.4%-91.5% for predicting in-hospital complications. Conclusion. A CT visual severity score is associated with clinical disease severity and evolves in a characteristic fashion during hospitalization for COVID-19. A prognostic model based on the CT visual severity score and clinical variables has strong performance in predicting in-hospital complications. Clinical Impact. The prognostic model using the CT visual severity score may help identify patients at highest risk of poor outcomes and guide early intervention.",2020,"Wang, Xiaofeng; Hu, Xingxing; Tan, Weijun; Mazzone, Peter; Mireles-Cabodevila, Eduardo; Han, Xiao-Zhen; Huang, Pingyue; Hu, Weihua; Dweik, Raed; Cheng, Zhenshun",,,#750803,,,,,221623745.0
li9ukoy9,,WHO,A New Remote Guided Method for Supervised Web-Based Cognitive Testing to Ensure High Quality Data,10.31234/osf.io/asc67,,,unk,"Background. The global COVID-19 pandemic has triggered a fundamental reexamination of how human psychological research can be conducted both safely and robustly in a new era of digital working and physical distancing. Online web-based testing has risen to the fore as a promising solution for rapid mass collection of cognitive data without requiring human contact. However, a long-standing debate exists over the data quality and validity of web-based studies. Here, we examine the opportunities and challenges afforded by the societal shift toward web-based testing, highlight an urgent need to establish a standard data quality assurance framework for online studies, and develop and validate a new supervised online testing methodology, remote guided testing (RGT). Methods. A total of 85 healthy young adults were tested on 10 cognitive tasks assessing executive functioning (flexibility, memory and inhibition) and learning. Tasks were administered either face-to-face in the laboratory (N=41) or online using remote guided testing (N=44), delivered using identical web-based platforms (CANTAB, Inquisit and i-ABC). Data quality was assessed using detailed trial-level measures (missed trials, outlying and excluded responses, response times), as well as overall task performance measures. Results. The results indicated that, across all measures of data quality and performance, RGT data was statistically-equivalent to data collected in person in the lab. Moreover, RGT participants out-performed the lab group on measured verbal intelligence, which could reflect test environment differences, including possible effects of mask-wearing on communication. Conclusions. These data suggest that the RGT methodology could help to ameliorate concerns regarding online data quality and - particularly for studies involving high-risk or rare cohorts - offer an alternative for collecting high-quality human cognitive data without requiring in-person physical attendance.",2021,"Leong, Victoria Raheel Kausar Yi Sim Jia Kacker Kriti Karlaftis Vasilis Vassiliu Chrysoula Chen S.

zqh52sv5,,WHO,Barriers for resuming endoscopy service in the context of COVID-19 pandemic: A multicenter survey from Egypt,,,,unk,"BACKGROUND: The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected routine endoscopy service across the gastroenterology community. This led to the suspension of service provision for elective cases. AIM: To assess the potential barriers for resuming the endoscopy service in Egypt. METHODS: A national online survey, four domains, was disseminated over a period of 4 wk in August 2020. The primary outcome of the survey was to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the endoscopy service and barriers to the full resumption of a disabled center(s). RESULTS: A hundred and thirteen Egyptian endoscopy centers participated in the survey. The waiting list was increased by &#8805; 50% in 44.9% of areas with clusters of COVID-19 cases (n = 49) and in 35.5% of areas with sporadic cases (n = 62). Thirty nine (34.8%) centers suffered from staff shortage, which was considered a barrier against service resumption by 86.4% of centers in per-protocol analysis. In multivariate analysis, the burden of cases in the unit locality, staff shortage/recovery and the availability of separate designated rooms for COVID-19 cases could markedly affect the resumption of endoscopy practice (P = 0.029, < 0.001 and 0.02, respectively) and Odd's ratio (0.15, 1.8 and 0.16, respectively). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to restrictions in endoscopic volumes. The staff shortage/recovery and the availability of COVID-19 designed rooms are the most important barriers against recovery.

Previous studies on COVID-19 mostly included older hospitalized-adults. Little information on infectivity among and characteristics of youngsters with COVID-19 is available. Methods A cluster of 22 close-contacts of a 22-year-old male (Patient-Index) including youngsters with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and hospitalized close-contacts testing negative for severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Anhui Province, China was prospectively-traced. Results Since January 23, 2020, we enrolled a cluster of eight youngsters with COVID-19 (median age [range], 22 [16–23] years; six males) originating from Patient-Index returning from Wuhan to Hefei on January 19. Patient-Index visited his 16-year-old female cousin in the evening on his return, and met 15 previous classmates in a get-together on January 21. He reported being totally asymptomatic and were described by all his contacts as healthy on January 19-21. His very first symptoms were itchy eyes and fever developed at noon and in the afternoon on January 22, respectively. Seven youngsters (his cousin and six classmates) became infected with COVID-19 after a-few-hour-contact with Patient-Index. None of the patients and contacts had visited Wuhan (except Patient-Index), or had any exposure to wet-markets, wild-animals, or medical-institutes within three months. For affected youngsters, the median incubation-period was 2 days (range, 1–4). The median serial-interval was 1 day (range, 0–4). Half or more of the eight COVID-19-infected youngsters had fever, cough, sputum production, nasal congestion, and fatigue on admission. All patients had mild conditions. Six patients developed pneumonia (all mild; one bilateral) on admission. As of February 20, four patients were discharged.

aj54phco,,WHO,Protection afforded by prior infection against SARS-CoV-2 reinfection with the Omicron variant,,,,unk,"BACKGROUNDNatural SARS-CoV-2 infection elicits strong protection against reinfection with the Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), and Delta (B.1.617.2) variants. However, the Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant harbors multiple mutations that can mediate immune evasion. We estimated effectiveness of prior infection in preventing reinfection (PES) with Omicron and other SARS-CoV-2 variants in Qatar. METHODSPES was estimated using the test-negative, case-control study design, employing a methodology that was recently investigated and validated for derivation of robust estimates for PES. Cases (PCR-positive persons with a variant infection) and controls (PCR-negative persons) were exact-matched by sex, 10-year age group, nationality, and calendar time of PCR test, to control for known differences in the risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection in Qatar. RESULTSPES against symptomatic reinfection was estimated at 90.2% (95% CI: 60.2-97.6) for Alpha, 84.8% (95% CI: 74.5-91.0) for Beta, 92.0% (95% CI: 87.9-94.7) for Delta, and 56.0% (95% CI: 50.6-60.9) for Omicron. Only 1 Alpha, 2 Beta, 0 Delta, and 2 Omicron reinfections progressed to severe COVID-19. None progressed to critical or fatal COVID-19. PES against hospitalization or death due to reinfection was estimated at 69.4% (95% CI: -143.6-96.2) for Alpha, 88.0% (95% CI: 50.7-97.1) for Beta, 100% (95% CI: 43.3-99.8) for Delta, and 87.8% (95% CI: 47.5-97.1) for Omicron. CONCLUSIONSProtection afforded by prior infection in preventing symptomatic reinfection with Alpha, Beta, or Delta is robust, at about 90%. While such protection against reinfection with Omicron is lower, it is still considerable at nearly 60%.

An estimated 16% global reduction in transplant activity occurred over the course of 2020, most markedly impacting kidney transplant and living donor programs, resulting in substantial knock-on effects for waitlisted patients. The increased severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection risk and excess deaths in transplant candidates has resulted in substantial effort to prioritize the safe restart and continuation of transplant programs over the second year of the pandemic, with transplant rates returning towards prepandemic levels. Over the past 2 y, COVID-19 mortality in SOT recipients has fallen from 20%-25% to 8%-10%, attributed to the increased and early availability of SARS-CoV-2 testing, adherence to nonpharmaceutical interventions, development of novel treatments, and vaccination. Despite these positive steps, transplant programs and SOT recipients continue to face challenges. Vaccine efficacy in SOT recipients is substantially lower than the general population and SOT recipients remain at an increased risk of adverse outcomes if they develop COVID-19.

However, it is not easily applicable in the setting of the total laparoscopic approach because of movement restriction. We herein propose a new and simple method of performing hemihepatectomy by Glissonian approach called temporary inflow control of the Glissonian pedicle (TICGL) technique. Dissection of the Glisson pedicle from the liver parenchyma is done until the posterior margin of the pedicle is visualized, and is clamped with bulldog clamps. Encircling the pedicle is not necessary. Resection of the liver parenchyma is performed under inflow control of the resected side liver providing less bleeding. After sufficient resection is done so that the whole Glissonian pedicle structures are visualized, the pedicle is encircled, often very easily without the fear of bleeding from the posterior side of the pedicle, which is a common problem when encircling is done before parenchymal resection. The staplers may then be applied safely without injuring the major hepatic veins since they have been already exposed. Stapling is done while the tape is retracted toward the contralateral side. This retraction prevents injury or stricture of the contralateral Glissonian pedicle branch. The remnant liver parenchyma is resected and hepatectomy finalized. The TICGL technique provides a safe and easy way of performing major hemihepatectomies, not only by expert laparoscopic surgeons but by less experienced surgeons.

This prospective cohort study included 2085 Nagreej village residents. Mass HCV screening was conducted and testing for HEV antibodies among HCV-infected patients performed. The annual incidence of HCV was recorded. Five hundred five (24.22%) of the tested villagers were positive for HCV RNA. Prevalence escalated with age and male sex. The main recorded risk factors were a history of surgery, dental procedures, hospitalization, blood transfusion, and antischistosomal treatment.

In the adjuvant setting, the potential value of adding palbociclib to endocrine therapy for hormone receptor-positive breast cancer has not been confirmed. PATIENTS AND METHODS In the prospective, randomized, phase III PALLAS trial, patients with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative early breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive 2 years of palbociclib (125 mg orally once daily, days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle) with adjuvant endocrine therapy or adjuvant endocrine therapy alone (for at least 5 years). The primary end point of the study was invasive disease-free survival (iDFS); secondary end points were invasive breast cancer-free survival, distant recurrence-free survival, locoregional cancer-free survival, and overall survival. RESULTS Among 5,796 patients enrolled at 406 centers in 21 countries worldwide over 3 years, 5,761 were included in the intention-to-treat population. At the final protocol-defined analysis, at a median follow-up of 31 months, iDFS events occurred in 253 of 2,884 (8.8%) patients who received palbociclib plus endocrine therapy and in 263 of 2,877 (9.1%) patients who received endocrine therapy alone, with similar results between the two treatment groups (iDFS at 4 years: 84.2% v 84.5%; hazard ratio, 0.96; CI, 0.81 to 1.14; P = .65). No significant differences were observed for secondary time-to-event end points, and subgroup analyses did not show any differences by subgroup. There were no new safety signals for palbociclib in this trial. CONCLUSION At this final analysis of the PALLAS trial, the addition of adjuvant palbociclib to standard endocrine therapy did not improve outcomes over endocrine therapy alone in patients with early hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.",2021-12-07,"Gnant, Michael; Dueck, Amylou C; Frantal, Sophie; Martin, Miguel; Burstein, Hal J; Greil, Richard; Fox, Peter; Wolff, Antonio C; Chan, Arlene; Winer, Eric P; Pfeiler, Georg; Miller, Kathy D; Colleoni, Marco; Suga, Jennifer M; Rubovsky, Gabor; Bliss, Judith M; Mayer, Ingrid A; Singer, Christian F; Nowecki, Zbigniew; Hahn, Olwen; Thomson, Jacqui; Wolmark, Norman; Amillano, Kepa; Rugo, Hope S; Steger, Guenther G; Hernando Fernández de Aránguiz, Blanca; Haddad, Tufia C; Perelló, Antonia; Bellet, Meritxell; Fohler, Hannes; Metzger Filho, Otto; Jallitsch-Halper, Anita; Solomon, Kadine; Schurmans, Céline; Theall, Kathy P; Lu, Dongrui R; Tenner, Kathleen; Fesl, Christian; DeMichele, Angela; Mayer, Erica L",Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.21.02554; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34874182/,245070496.0

Healthcare systems were not designed to deal with this crisis: an unpredictable, large-scale challenge that has required urgent resource mobilization, affecting whole populations. However, there has also been no time to debate systems' abilities to deal with the crisis, not least because the pandemic opposes the general direction of these systems. The urgent need for new fast-track, quick-win projects was necessary because we were time-constrained. We also needed an effective approach − which globally known project management tools could be efficiently applied? The widely accepted Project Management Institute (PMI) model and the popular Six Sigma Define, Measure, Analyze, Implement, Control (DMAIC) approach were two reasonable methodologies to select, so we aimed to modify these tools to achieve quick results. An initial needs assessment of the pandemic's challenges required careful consideration of our high-impact healthcare facilities' ability to meet those challenges. Our assessment concluded that ability was limited, and as Lean Six Sigma DMAIC principles are more effectively applicable to quality improvement initiatives, the combined application of DMAIC and PMI principles, which enable robust and stable project initiation, governance, enterprise engagement, and measurable quality deliverables, enabled us to focus on structured project management and quality outcomes. METHODS: This modified approach was applied to the 10 main Ministry of Health (MOH) hospitals and 2 specialized care centers in the Al-Ahsa region, to design and initiate 40 mini-projects that could yield quick wins. This study was designed to measure the value of applying these tools and learn lessons retrospectively.

Whilst food safety regulations have been introduced over the past few years to maintain the microbial safety of foods sold from these wet markets, it remains unclear whether the hygiene maintenance that is performed on the wooden cutting boards used for meat-processing is effective. In fact, hygiene maintenance may often be overlooked, and hygiene standards may be insufficient. If so, this may lead to the spread of harmful pathogens through cross-contamination, thereby causing severe risks to public health. The aim of this study was to determine the level of microbial transfer between wooden cutting boards and swine meat of various qualities, using 16S metagenomic sequencing, strain identification and biofilm screening of isolated strains. The results established that: (a) the traditional hygiene practices used for cleaning wooden cutting boards in Hong Kong’s wet markets expose the surfaces to potentially harmful microorganisms; (b) the processing of microbially contaminated meat on cutting boards cleaned using traditional practices leads to cross-contamination; and (c) several potentially pathogenic microorganisms found on the cutting boards have good biofilm-forming abilities. These results reinforce the need to review the traditional methods used to clean wooden cutting boards after the processing of raw meat in Hong Kong’ wet markets so as to prevent cross-contamination events.

The size of the encapsulated Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework-67 (ZIF-67) is well controlled to 100 nm due to the spatial confinement effect of HMCS, and the electrical conductivity of ZIF-67 is also increased significantly. The ZIF@HMCS-25% hybrid material obtained exhibits a highly efficient oxygen reduction reaction activity with 0.823 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode) half-wave potential and an even higher kinetic current density (J K = 13.8 mA cm-2) than commercial Pt/C. ZIF@HMCS-25% also displays excellent oxygen evolution reaction performance and the overpotential of ZIF@HMCS-25% at 10 mA cm-2 is 407 mV. In addition, ZIF@HMCS-25% is further employed as an air electrode for a rechargeable Zn-air battery, exhibiting a high power density (120.2 mW cm-2 at 171.4 mA cm-2) and long-term charge/discharge stability (80 h at 5 mA cm-2).

We observed that some laboratory investigations provided redundant information regarding outcomes, and, therefore, were not necessary. Therefore, the extent of laboratory investigations may need to be pared down to not only avoid issues related to repeated blood sampling but also to minimize the financial burdens in poor socioeconomic countries. Objective This study aimed to observe trends of clinical and laboratory values in COVID-19 patients and their relationship to outcomes, including disease severity, length of hospital stay, and mortality. Methods We conducted an observational cohort study of COVID-19 patients treated as inpatients at the Shifa International Hospital (SIH) in Islamabad in April 2020. Patients were included if they were nonsurgical, adult inpatients of SIH diagnosed with COVID-19 via positive polymerase chain reaction test. We monitored study participants' clinical and laboratory values (including hypoxia) on admission and throughout the study period. We used IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 23.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) for data entry and analysis. Descriptive statistics were calculated for qualitative and quantitative data. We determined the effect of all variables on outcomes through chi-squared or Fisher's exact test, and p-values <0.05 with 95% confidence interval were considered statistically significant. Results A total of 51 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. Most of the study participants were men older than age 50 with multiple comorbidities and resided in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Length of hospital stay ranged from eight to 14 days, and most patients had severe disease and survived. Factors such as patient age, gender, comorbid conditions, residence, and medication did not significantly affect outcomes. Hypotension during the height of symptoms and oxygen saturations <80% on admission was associated with prolonged hospital stays. Two complete blood count (CBC) parameters (platelet counts and mean corpuscular volume, MCV) were strongly associated with mortality and severity in our patients. Four non-CBC parameters (alanine transaminase, ALT; D-dimer; C-reactive protein, CRP; and lactate dehydrogenase, LDH) had strong statistical impact on disease severity, length of hospital stay, and mortality in our patients. Conclusion In a resource-limited country, laboratory testing must be chosen wisely and used appropriately. Patient age, gender, comorbid conditions, drugs, residence, and ferritin levels did not affect COVID-19 outcomes. Hemoglobin, platelet count, MCV, CRP, D-dimer, ALT, LDH, hypoxia, and hypotension were all correlated to disease outcomes.

Research Design & Methods: The research method is based on a comparative analysis of case studies. To investigate the impact of Covid-19 on small family businesses in Poland, we conducted exploratory studies in 12 entities, based on 29 partially structured interviews with managers of these companies. Findings: The sudden spread of the Covid-19 pandemic around the world took many lives and caused severe restrictions in social and private life, including the business sector. While almost every firm has been affected by the pandemic crisis, small businesses, dominated by family businesses, are particularly vulnerable to it. Our findings show that the Covid-19 crisis affects all companies and presents a completely new challenge that has so far had no precedent. Small family businesses are not prepared for the prolonged state of uncertainty and tension threatening the continuity of their operations, which particularly endangers financial stability and employee maintenance. In responding to the crisis, small family firms cannot refer to previous experience or developed methods and patterns of operation. Implications & Recommendations: Small family businesses must quickly adapt their operations to changing conditions, regardless of their size and industry in which they operate.

Patients were contacted 10 days afterwards to ascertain wellbeing and actions taken, and patients were asked rate the service on a Likert scale. Post-study informal discussions were conducted with hospital staff. Results: In total, 142 patients met inclusion criteria. Groups 0, 1, 2 and 3 had 61, 16, 44 and 21 patients, respectively. Common diagnosis was sore throat (73%). Only one patient took antibiotics after 3 days. Nearly all (141/142) patients were successfully contacted on day 10, and of these, 102 (72%) rated their experiences as good or very good.

cy0jlcuf,,WHO,Interoperator Reliability of Lung Ultrasound during the COVID-19 Pandemic,,,,unk,"AIM: Lung ultrasound (LUS) is a reliable, radiation-free, and bedside imaging technique used to assess several pulmonary diseases. Although COVID-19 is diagnosed with a nasopharyngeal swab, detection of pulmonary involvement is crucial for safe patient discharge. Computed tomography (CT) is currently the gold standard. To treat paucisymptomatic patients, we have implemented a ""fast track"" pathway in our emergency department, using LUS as a valid alternative. Minimal data is available in the literature about interobserver reliability and the level of expertise needed to perform a reliable examination. Our aim was to assess these. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a single-center prospective study. We enrolled 96 patients. 12 lung areas were explored in each patient with a semiquantitative assessment of pulmonary aeration loss in order to obtain the LUS score. Scans were performed by two different operators, an expert and a novice, who were blinded to their colleague's results. RESULTS: 96 patients were enrolled. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) showed excellent agreement between the expert and the novice operator (ICC 0.975; 0.962-0.983); demographic features (age, sex, and chronic pulmonary disease) did not influence the reproducibility of the method. The ICC was 0.973 (0.950-0.986) in males, 0.976 (0.959-0.986) in females; 0.965 (0.940-0.980) in younger patients (&#8804;â46 yrs), and 0.973 (0.952-0.985) in older (>â46 yrs) patients. The ICC was 0.967 (0.882-0.991) in patients with pulmonary disease and 0.975 (0.962-0.984) in the other patients. The learning curve showed an increase in interobserver agreement.

Recent evidence shows that the virus utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a spike protein receptor for entry into target host cells. The bovine ACE2 contains key residues for binding to the spike protein receptor-binding domain. This study evaluated the hypothesis that bovine gonadotroph expresses ACE2, and spike protein suppresses luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion from cultured bovine anterior pituitary (AP) cells. ACE2 mRNA expression and ACE2 protein expression were detected in the bovine AP cells using reverse transcription PCR and western blot analysis. Immunofluorescence microscopy analysis with the anti-ACE2 antibody revealed the co-localization of ACE2 and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor on the gonadotroph plasma membrane. Approximately 90% of GnRH receptor-positive cells expressed ACE2, and approximately 46% of ACE2-positive cells expressed the GnRH receptor. We cultured bovine AP cells for 3.5 days and treated them with increasing concentrations (0, 0.07, 0.7, or 7 pM) of recombinant spike protein having both S1 and S2 regions. The spike protein (0.07–7 pM) suppressed both basal and GnRH-induced LH secretion (P < 0.05). Spike protein (0.7–7 pM) suppressed GnRH-induced (P < 0.05), but not basal FSH secretion. In contrast, pre-treatment with ERK 1/2/5 inhibitor (U0126) partially restored the GnRH-induced LH and FSH secretion from the spike protein suppression. Collectively, the results indicate that gonadotrophs express ACE2, a receptor for coronavirus 2 spike protein, which in turn suppresses LH and FSH secretion from AP cells.",2022-01-27,"ABDILLAH, Dimas Arya; KEREILWE, Onalenna; FERDOUSY, Raihana Nasrin; SAITO, Risa; KADOKAWA, Hiroya",J Reprod Dev,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/57627b30c76b3a4591d9b8a5c741d798c26e0251.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8979804.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35082199/; https://doi.org/10.1262/jrd.2021-126,246296566.0

Our study uncovers, strong neutralizing mucosal component (NT50 ≤ 50pM), emanating from intramuscular administration of an mRNA vaccine. We show that saliva of BNT162b2 vaccinees contains temporary IgA targeting the Receptor-Binding-Domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and demonstrate that these IgAs are key mediators of potent neutralization. RBD-targeting IgAs were found to associate with the Secretory Component, indicating their bona-fide transcytotic origin and their dimeric tetravalent nature. The mechanistic understanding of the exceptionally high neutralizing activity provided by mucosal IgA, acting at the first line of defence, will advance vaccination design and surveillance principles, pointing to novel treatment approaches, and to new routes of vaccine administration and boosting.

Temporary changes in re-imbursement, inclusion of home office and patient home environments, and increased access to telehealth technologies by patients, health care staff and health care facilities were key to provide an environment for creative and consistent high-quality stroke care. The continuum of care via telestroke has broadened to include prehospital, inter-facility and intra-facility hospital-based services, stroke telerehabilitation, and ambulatory telestroke. However, disparities in technology access remain a challenge.

Can one anticipate such a spread and allow healthcare administrators to prepare for a surge a priori? We posit that the answer lies in distinguishing between two types of waves in epidemic dynamics. The first kind resembles a spatio-temporal diffusion pattern. Its gradual spread allows administrators to marshal resources to combat the epidemic. The second kind is caused by super-spreader events, which provide shocks to the disease propagation dynamics. Such shocks simultaneously affect a large geographical region and leave little time for the healthcare system to respond. <br><br>Methods: We use time-series analysis and epidemiological model estimation to detect and react to such simultaneous waves using COVID-19 data from the time when the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus dominated the spread. We first analyze India's second wave from April to May 2021 that overwhelmed the Indian healthcare system. Then, we analyze data of COVID-19 infections in the United States (US) and countries with a high and low Indian diaspora. <br><br>Results: We identify the Kumbh Mela festival as the likely super-spreader event, the exogenous shock, behind India's second wave. We show that a multi-area compartmental epidemiological model does not fit such shock-induced disease dynamics well, in contrast to its performance with diffusion-type spread. The insufficient fit to infection data can be detected in the early stages of a shock-wave propagation and can be used as an early warning sign, providing valuable time for a planned healthcare response. Our analysis of COVID-19 infections in the US reveals that simultaneous waves due to super-spreader events in one country (India) can lead to simultaneous waves in other places. The US wave in the summer of 2021 does not fit a diffusion pattern either. We postulate that international travels from India caused this wave. To support that hypothesis, we demonstrate that countries with a high Indian diaspora exhibit infection growth soon after India's second wave, compared to countries with a low Indian diaspora.<br><br>Conclusions: Based on our data analysis, we provide concrete policy recommendations at various stages of a simultaneous wave, including how to avoid it, how to detect it quickly after a potential super-spreader event occurs, and how to proactively contain its spread.",2021,"Souyris, Sebastian Hao Shuai Bose Subhonmesh England Albert Charles III Ivanov Anton Mukherjee Ujjal Kumar Seshadri Sridhar",,,#ppcovidwho-296052,,,,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3960987,244441690.0

The COVID-19 crisis provides an unprecedented opportunity to investigate this considerably further. Further, whether cryptocurrencies provide a diversification for equities is still an unsettled issue. We employ several econometric procedures, including wavelet coherence, and neural network analyses to rigorously examine the role of COVID-19 on the paired co-movements of four cryptocurrencies, with seven equity indices (matching countries particularly impacted by COVID-19). Our period of study includes one year prior to the onset of COVID-19, and one year during the pandemic, extending deeper into the pandemic period (February 2021) than most previous studies. We find co-movements between cryptocurrencies and equity indices gradually increased as COVID-19 progressed. However, most of these co-movements are either modestly positively correlated, or minimal, suggesting cryptocurrencies in general do not provide a diversification benefit during either normal times or downturns. An exception, however, is the co-movement of tether. Tether co-moves negatively with equities to an economically signficant degree, both pre COVID-19, and considerably more during COVID-19. Co-movements between tether and equity indices spiked sharply during identified waves of the pandemic.

The objective of this study was to determine if cognitive processing therapy (CPT) for PTSD among active duty military personnel and veterans would result in increased acceptability, fewer dropouts, and better outcomes when delivered In-Home or by Telehealth as compared to In-Office treatment. METHODS: The trial used an equipoise-stratified randomization design in which participants (N = 120) could decline none or any 1 arm of the study and were then randomized equally to 1 of the remaining arms. Therapists delivered CPT in 12 sessions lasting 60-min each. Self-reported PTSD symptoms on the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) served as the primary outcome. RESULTS: Over half of the participants (57%) declined 1 treatment arm. Telehealth was the most acceptable and least often refused delivery format (17%), followed by In-Office (29%), and In-Home (54%); these differences were significant (p = 0.0008). Significant reductions in PTSD symptoms occurred with all treatment formats (p < .0001). Improvement on the PCL-5 was about twice as large in the In-Home (d = 2.1) and Telehealth (d = 2.0) formats than In-Office (d = 1.3); those differences were statistically large and significant (d = 0.8, 0.7 and p = 0.009, 0.014, respectively). There were no significant differences between In-Home and Telehealth outcomes (p = 0.77, d = −.08). Dropout from treatment was numerically lowest when therapy was delivered In-Home (25%) compared to Telehealth (34%) and In-Office (43%), but these differences were not statistically significant.

Despite this, the fields of air pollution and air quality monitoring remain plagued with unsolved problems. In this study, the Pollution Weather Prediction System (PWP) is proposed to perform air pollution prediction for outdoor sites for various pollution parameters. In the presented research work, we introduced a PWP system configured with pollution-sensing units, such as SDS021, MQ07-CO, NO2-B43F, and Aeroqual Ozone (O(3)). These sensing units were utilized to collect and measure various pollutant levels, such as PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO(2), and O(3), for 90 days at Symbiosis International University, Pune, Maharashtra, India. The data collection was carried out between the duration of December 2019 to February 2020 during the winter. The investigation results validate the success of the presented PWP system. In the conducted experiments, linear regression and artificial neural network (ANN)-based AQI (air quality index) predictions were performed. Furthermore, the presented study also found that the customized linear regression methodology outperformed other machine-learning methods, such as linear, ridge, Lasso, Bayes, Huber, Lars, Lasso-lars, stochastic gradient descent (SGD), and ElasticNet regression methodologies, and the customized ANN regression methodology used in the conducted experiments.

Of the 388 COVID-19-related deaths occurring nationwide, most occurred in the community. We report findings from COVID-19 mortality surveillance among community deaths brought to the University Teaching Hospital (UTH) mortuary in Lusaka. Methods: In Zambia, when a person dies in the community, and is brought into a health facility mortuary, they are recorded as 'brought in dead' (BID). The UTH mortuary accepts persons BID for Lusaka District, the most populated district in Zambia. We analyzed data for persons BID at UTH during 2020. We analyzed two data sources: weekly SARS-CoV-2 test results for persons BID and monthly all-cause mortality numbers among persons BID. For all-cause mortality among persons BID, monthly deaths during 2020 that were above the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval for the historic mean (2017-2019) were considered significant. Spearman's rank test was used to correlate the overall percent positivity in Zambia with all-cause mortality and SARS-CoV-2 testing among persons BID at UTH mortuary. Results: During 2020, 7,756 persons were BID at UTH (monthly range 556-810). SARS-CoV-2 testing began in April 2020, and through December 3,131 (51.9%) of 6,022 persons BID were tested. Of these, 212 (6.8%) were SARS-CoV-2 positive with weekly percent test positivity ranging from 0-32%, with the highest positivity occurring during July 2020. There were 1,139 excess persons BID from all causes at UTH mortuary in 2020 compared to the 2017-2019 mean. The monthly number of persons BID from all causes was above the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval during June-September and December. Conclusion: Increases in all-cause mortality and SARS-CoV-2 test positivity among persons BID at UTH mortuary corresponded with the first peak of the COVID-19 epidemic in June and August 2020, indicating possible increased mortality related to the COVID-19 epidemic in Zambia. Combining all-cause mortality and SARS-CoV-2 testing for persons BID provides useful information about the severity of the epidemic in Lusaka and should be implemented throughout Zambia.",2021-11-15,"Hamukale, A.; Hines, J.

Nucleic acid amplification tests are the gold standard for diagnosis of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, and many real-time PCR diagnostic assays have been developed. Mutations that occur within the primer/probe binding regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome can negatively impact the performance of diagnostic assays. Here, we report two single-point mutations in the N gene of SARS-CoV-2 associated with N gene target detection failures in the Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay, the first a C to T mutation at position 29197, found in five patients, and the second a C to T mutation at position 29200, found in eight patients. By sequencing the Xpert amplicons, we showed both mutations to be located within the amplified region of the Xpert N gene target. This report highlights the necessity for multiple genetic targets and the continual monitoring and evaluation of diagnostic assay performance. IMPORTANCE This paper reports the identification of single-point mutations in the N gene of SARS-CoV-2 associated with a gene target failure by the Cepheid Xpert commercial system. In order to determine the mutation(s) responsible for the N gene detection failures, the genomic products from the Cepheid Xpert system were sequenced and compared to whole genomes of SARS-CoV-2 from clinical cases. This report is the first to our knowledge which characterizes the amplified PCR products of the Xpert system, confirming the mutations associated with the gene target failure.

Among all ROS-producing enzymes, the members of NADPH oxidases (NOXs), which are widely expressed in different lung cell types, have been shown to participate in cellular processes involved in the maintenance of lung integrity. It is not surprising that change in NOXs’ expression and function is involved in the development of ALI/ARDS. In this context, the use of NOX inhibitors could be a possible therapeutic perspective in the management of this syndrome.

Despite this, the unique communication and technical skills required for virtual encounters are not routinely taught or practiced in graduate medical education (GME) programs. Objective To develop an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) case to assess residents' telemedicine-specific skills and identify potential gaps in our residency program's curriculum. Methods As part of a multi-station OSCE in 2019, we developed a case simulating a remote encounter between a resident and a recently discharged standardized patient. We developed an assessment tool comprising specific behaviors anchored to ""not done,"" ""partly done,"" and ""well done"" descriptors to evaluate core communication and telemedicine-specific skills. Results Seventy-eight NYU internal medicine residents participated in the case. Evaluations from 100% of participants were obtained. Residents performed well in Information Gathering and Relationship Development domains. A mean 95% (SD 3.3%) and 91% (SD 4.9%) of residents received ""well done"" evaluations across these domains. A mean 78% (SD 14%) received ""well done"" within Education/Counseling domain. However, only 46% (SD 45%) received ""well done"" evaluations within the Telemedicine domain; specific weak areas included performing a virtual physical examination (18% well done) and leveraging video to augment history gathering (17% well done).

However, while what is said might easily uphold a lie, how it is said may reveal deception. Hence, some features of the voice that are difficult for liars to control may keep speech mostly, if not always, honest. Previous research has identified that speech timing and voice pitch cues can predict the truthfulness of speech, but this evidence has come primarily from laboratory experiments, which sacrifice ecological validity for experimental control. We obtained ecologically valid recordings of deceptive speech while observing natural utterances from players of a popular social deduction board game, in which players are assigned roles that either induce honest or dishonest interactions. When speakers chose to lie, they were prone to longer and more frequent pauses in their speech. This finding is in line with theoretical predictions that lying is more cognitively demanding. However, lying was not reliably associated with vocal pitch. This contradicts predictions that increased physiological arousal from lying might increase muscular tension in the larynx, but is consistent with human specialisations that grant Homo sapiens sapiens an unusual degree of control over the voice relative to other primates.

Ferroptosis-causing radicals that are targeted by ferroptosis suppressors have not been unequivocally identified. Because certain cytochrome P450 substrate drugs can prevent lipid peroxidation via obscure mechanisms, we evaluated their antiferroptotic potential and used them to identify ferroptosis-causing radicals. METHODS Using a cell-based assay, we screened cytochrome P450 substrate compounds to identify drugs with antiferroptotic activity and investigated the underlying mechanism. To evaluate radical-scavenging activity, we used electron paramagnetic resonance-spin trapping methods and a fluorescence probe for lipid radicals, NBD-Pen, that we had developed. We then assessed the therapeutic potency of these drugs in mouse models of cisplatin-induced AKI and LPS/galactosamine-induced liver injury. RESULTS We identified various US Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs and hormones that have antiferroptotic properties, including rifampicin, promethazine, omeprazole, indole-3-carbinol, carvedilol, propranolol, estradiol, and thyroid hormones. The antiferroptotic drug effects were closely associated with the scavenging of lipid peroxyl radicals but not significantly related to interactions with other radicals. The elevated lipid peroxyl radical levels were associated with ferroptosis onset, and known ferroptosis suppressors, such as ferrostatin-1, also functioned as lipid peroxyl radical scavengers. The drugs exerted antiferroptotic activities in various cell types, including tubules, podocytes, and renal fibroblasts. Moreover, in mice, the drugs ameliorated AKI and liver injury, with suppression of tissue lipid peroxidation and decreased cell death.

mri8gg9p,,WHO,Does the protein corona take over the selectivity of molecularly imprinted nanoparticles? The biological challenges to recognition,,,,unk,"""Plastic antibodies"" are nano-sized biomimetics prepared by the molecular imprinting technology, which have the robustness of polymers, but specificity and selectivity alike natural receptors making them ideal for analytical uses. The current challenge is to translate plastic antibodies to in vivo applications for diagnosis, drug delivery, theranostic, therefore it is crucial to evaluate the effect of the biological sample complexity on the selectivity and the formation of protein corona (PCs), which ultimately dictate the fate of circulating nanoparticles. A set (n = 4) of plastic antibodies (nanoMIPs) against different proteins was prepared. Quantitative (iBAC) shotgun proteomics permitted to define the PC composition of nanoMIPs in human plasma, the relative protein abundances, the correlation between PC and the plasma dilution. NanoMIPs showed >200 proteins PC, while ~150 proteins were found on controls, suggesting the imprinting process influences the nanoparticle's structure hence the protein uptake. NanoMIPs and controls shared the 44% of the PC, but PC iBAQ values on nanoMIPs were 10-100 times higher than controls, suggesting PC/nanoMIPs interactions were far stronger than PC/non imprinted particles. PCs were richer in small proteins and in immunoglobulins, indicating a defensive response, while the selectivity was negatively challenged in the crowded plasma sample. SIGNIFICANCE: The formation and the composition of the protein corona (PC) is key to decide the fate of nanoparticles when in vivo, therefore there is the strong need to study the composition of the PC. To enable and to support the translation of the use of plastic antibodies (nanoMIPs), prepared by means of the molecular imprinting technique, to the clinical practice and to in vivo uses, the present work evaluates the effects of the complexity of the biological sample (plasma) on nanoMIPs composed of highly crosslinked polyacrylamide and acrylamide derivatives. Proteomic study offers an in depth insight of the protein corona formed in plasma on nanoMIPs. A set of nanoMIPs synthesized and raised to recognize either small or large proteins was tested. The selection abilities of the nanoMIPs when placed in plasma at different dilutions was studied. Quantitative shotgun proteomics allowed to define the composition of the formed protein corona (PC) enabling to detail the protein compositions, the relative abundances, its correlation to the biological sample composition and the correlation between PC and nanoMIP's imprinted template. In plasma, all the nanoMIPs gained a PC composed of more than 200 proteins. Type of protein recruited for the corona, molecular weight and abundance in the PC were studied.

While the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic unfolded, NSW experienced increased activity of mosquito-borne Ross River virus. All these extreme events created many challenges for managing the pest and the public health risks associated with mosquitoes, from maintenance of mosquito monitoring and control programs through to unique challenges of communicating mosquito bite prevention advice to local communities. There are important lessons to be learned in situations where extreme weather events may influence the risk of mosquito-borne disease through driving changes in the abundance and diversity of mosquito populations, while also influencing the abundance and distribution of native wildlife that represents important local reservoirs of arboviruses. Similarly, supporting the maintenance of mosquito monitoring and management programs while local authorities face competing priorities due to extreme natural disasters and/or public health events is critical.",2020-12-09,"Webb, Cameron E",Public health research & practice,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.17061/phrp3042027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33294903/,228078855.0

Both natural and anthropogenic pollutants affect air quality in the Gulf Cooperation Council. Dust storms are frequent over the region during spring (March-May) and summer (June-August) seasons and load large amounts of dust particles in the atmosphere reducing visibility, affecting human activities, and causing severe air pollution. Unprecedented infrastructure activities, overusing governmental subsidized energy, water desalination plants, heavy traffic in large cities, and industrial plants are largely contributing to the anthropogenic aerosol emissions in the Gulf Cooperation Council region. Dust and aerosol particle deposition affect the marine environment and phytoplankton growth in the Arabian Gulf (AG) and the Sea of Oman (SO). The oil well fire in Kuwait during the 1991 Gulf War I and the drone attack on the oil refineries over Saudi Arabia in 2019 show that the region is vulnerable to war and terrorist attacks that can cause a regional environmental disaster. Morphological characterization of aerosol particles in the Gulf Cooperation Council region shows dust particles mostly dominating with the large intrusion of industrial pollutants.

Public discourse about the practical and ethical implications of AI has mainly focussed on the societal level. There is an emerging knowledge base on AI risks to human rights around data security and privacy concerns. A separate strand of work has highlighted the stresses of working in the gig economy. This prevailing focus on human rights and gig impacts has been at the expense of a closer look at how AI may be reshaping traditional workplace relations and, more specifically, workplace health and safety. To address this gap, we outline a conceptual model for developing an AI Work Health and Safety (WHS) Scorecard as a tool to assess and manage the potential risks and hazards to workers resulting from AI use in a workplace. A qualitative, practice-led research study of AI adopters was used to generate and test a novel list of potential AI risks to worker health and safety. Risks were identified after cross-referencing Australian AI Ethics Principles and Principles of Good Work Design with AI ideation, design and implementation stages captured by the AI Canvas, a framework otherwise used for assessing the commercial potential of AI to a business.

However, in the obstetric patient, the scientific evidence is limited, and even more so when it comes to COVID-19 infection in obstetric intensive care settings. For this reason, an unsystematic narrative review of the literature was performed using MEDLINE, scientific societies, as well as the repositories of the World Health Organisation and the Ministry of Health and Social Protection of Colombia as sources of information, in order to describe the management of a pregnant patient with COVID-19 in an intensive care unit. It is emphasised that care must be carried out by a multidisciplinary team, using maternal and fetal monitoring when appropriate. It is also suggested that there must be monitoring of oxygen saturation and maternal haemodynamics in order to minimise fetal hypoxaemia.

A customized cytokine microdelivery apparatus was used to ensure the constant rate and concentration of cytokine delivery around the scaffold. The formation of osteoid or early cartilage was observed after 4 weeks in specimens treated with SDF-1α and either BMP-2 or TGF-β1. The density of cellular infiltrate and formation of differentiated tissue were lower in scaffolds treated only with BMP-2 or TGF-β1.

Our aims were to determine whether the vertebral body cortex protects against ablation-induced spinal cord injury; correlate radiofrequency, cryo-, and microwave ablation parameters with resulting spinal ablation zone dimensions and describe normal spinal marrow postablation changes on MR imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS Ten thoracolumbar vertebrae in 3 sheep were treated with radiofrequency ablation, cryoablation, or microwave ablation under fluoroscopic guidance. Technique parameters were chosen to produce ablation zones that exceeded the volume of the vertebral bodies in sheep 1 and were confined to the vertebrae in sheep 2 and 3. Expected ablation zone dimensions were based on data provided by the device manufacturers. Postablation MR imaging was performed at 48 hours (sheep 1) or 7 days (sheep 2 and 3). RESULTS In sheep 1, cryoablation and microwave ablations extended into the spinal canal and caused histologically confirmed neurologic injury, but radiofrequency ablation did not. The mean difference between the lengths of the radiofrequency ablation zone dimensions measured on gross pathology compared with those expected was 9.6 ± 4.1 mm. The gross pathologic cryo- and microwave ablation zone dimensions were within 1 mm of those expected. All modalities produced a nonenhancing ablation zone with a rim of enhancement, corresponding histologically to marrow necrosis and hemorrhagic congestion. CONCLUSIONS An intact cortex appears to protect against radiofrequency ablation-induced spinal cord injury, but not against non-impedance-based modalities. Ablation dimensions produced by microwave and cryoablation are similar to those expected, while radiofrequency ablation dimensions are smaller. Ablation of normal marrow produces a rim of enhancement at the margin of the ablation zone on MR imaging.",2017,"Wallace, A N; Hillen, T J; Friedman, M V; Zohny, Z S; Stephens, B H; Greco, S C; Talcott, M R; Jennings, J W",AJNR.

We examined the behavioural and neural effects of an acute dose of LDX (50 mg) in 22 women with binge-eating symptomatology using a randomised, crossover, double-blind, placebo-controlled experimental medicine design. LDX reduced self-reported appetite ratings and intake of both a pasta meal and a palatable cookie snack. LDX also decreased the eating rate of pasta but not of cookies and reduced self-reported liking ratings for pasta at the end of the meal. When viewing food pictures during an fMRI scan, LDX reduced activity bilaterally in the thalamus. LDX enhanced sustained attention and reduced impulsive responding in a continuous performance task but had no effect on emotional bias or working memory. These results suggest the observed effects of LDX on food intake (and by implication the efficacy of LDX in treating BED) may be related to the actions of the drug to enhance satiety, reduce food-related reward responding when full and/or increase cognitive control.

The spike glycoprotein (S-protein), anchored onto the virus envelope, is the trimer of S-protein comprised of S1 and S2 domains which interacts with host cell receptors and facilitates virus-cell membrane fusion. The S1 domain comprises of a receptor binding domain (RBD) possessing an N-terminal domain and two subdomains (SD1 and SD2). Certain regions of S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 such as S2 domain and fragment of the RBD remain conserved despite the high selection pressure. These conserved regions of the S-protein are extrapolated as the potential target for developing molecular diagnostic techniques. Further, the S-protein acts as an antigenic target for different serological assay platforms for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Virus-specific IgM and IgG antibodies can be used to detect viral proteins in ELISA and lateral flow immunoassays. The S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 has very high sequence similarity to SARS-CoV-1, and the monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against SARS-CoV-1 cross-react with S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 and neutralize its activity. Furthermore, in vitro studies have demonstrated that polyclonal antibodies targeted against the RBD of S-protein of SARS-CoV-1 can neutralize SARS-CoV-2 thus inhibiting its infectivity in permissive cell lines. Research on coronaviral S-proteins paves the way for the development of vaccines that may prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and alleviate the current global coronavirus pandemic. However, specific neutralizing mAbs against SARS-CoV-2 are in clinical development. Therefore, neutralizing antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 S-protein are promising specific antiviral therapeutics for pre-and post-exposure prophylaxis and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Alongside efforts to reconfigure services and enable continued delivery of safe clinical care for patients with IBD, consideration must also be given to management of IBD research activity. In many centres there has been an effective shutdown of IBD clinical trial activity as research sites have switched focus to either COVID-19 related research or clinical care only. As a result, the early termination of trial programmes and loss of potentially effective therapeutic options for IBD, has become a real and worrying prospect. Moreover, in many countries research activity has become embedded into clinical care - with clinical trials often providing access to new therapies or strategies - which would otherwise not have been available in standard clinical pathways. This pandemic has significant implications for the design, conduct, analysis and reporting of clinical trials in IBD.

Many tumors overexpress arginase, but it is unclear how these cancers, but not T cells, tolerate arginine depletion. In this study, we show that tumor cells synthesize arginine from citrulline by upregulating argininosuccinate synthetase 1 (ASS1). Under arginine starvation, ASS1 transcription is induced by ATF4 and CEBPβ binding to an enhancer within ASS1. T cells cannot induce ASS1, despite the presence of active ATF4 and CEBPβ, as the gene is repressed. Arginine starvation drives global chromatin compaction and repressive histone methylation, which disrupts ATF4/CEBPβ binding and target gene transcription. We find that T cell activation is impaired in arginine-depleted conditions, with significant metabolic perturbation linked to incomplete chromatin remodeling and misregulation of key genes.

The conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is the preferred tool for detecting serum antibodies specific for pathogens; however, the utility of conventional ELISA with respect to detection of MERS-CoV antibodies is limited due to the number of false-positives caused by cross-reactivity of serum antibodies with antigens that are conserved among coronaviruses.

Employing combined therapy of modern medicine and traditional Chinese medicine has been proposed, in which Ma Xing Shi Gan Decoction (MXSGD) was recommended as a basic prescription and applied widely in the clinical treatment of COVID-19. We investigated the underlying mechanism of MXSGD in treating COVID-19 utilizing the approaches of integrating network pharmacology. A total of 97 active ingredients of MXSGD were screened out, and 169 targets were predicted. The protein-protein interaction network exhibited hub targets of MXSGD, such as Heat shock protein 90, RAC-alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase, Transcription factor AP-1, Mitogen-activated protein kinase 1, Cellular tumor antigen p53, Vascular endothelial growth factor A, and Tumour necrosis factor. Gene Ontology functional enrichment analysis demonstrated that the biological processes altered within the body after taking MXSGD were closely related to the regulation of such processes as the acute inflammatory response, chemokine production, vascular permeability, response to oxygen radicals, oxidative stress-induced apoptosis, T cell differentiation involved in the immune response, immunoglobulin secretion, and extracellular matrix disassembly. KEGG enrichment analysis indicated that the targets of MXSGD were significantly enriched in inflammation-related pathways, immunomodulation-related pathways, and viral infection-related pathways.

DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Excerpta Medica Database, and Cochrane library between December 1, 2019, and August 26, 2020. STUDY SELECTION: Investigators screened 360 unique references, retrieved published autopsy series, and report on the postmortem histopathologic information on patients who had died of coronavirus disease 2019. DATA EXTRACTION: Investigators independently abstracted all available data including study design, participant demographics, key histopathologic findings, disease severity markers, duration of hospital stay, and cause of death. DATA SYNTHESIS: From the 65 eligible studies, 691 total completed autopsies were included in evidence synthesis. Histopathologic evaluation of the lungs revealed presence of diffuse alveolar damage in 323 of 443 patients and pulmonary microthrombi in 242 of 326 patients. Deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism were found in 41% and ~15%, respectively, of the cadavers examined for thromboembolic events. d-dimer levels were generally higher in patients with severe clinical course of coronavirus disease 2019. Plasma levels of ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, interleukin-6, and C-reactive protein were higher in nonsurvivors when compared with survivors. Overall, microthrombi and extensive angiogenesis of lung vasculature were the most common pathologic findings in the lungs and microthrombi in most of the assessed organ-tissue. CONCLUSIONS: Diffuse alveolar damage was the most predominant feature in the lungs of coronavirus disease 2019 patients who underwent postmortem assessment. Widespread pulmonary microthrombosis and extensive pulmonary angiogenesis, in addition to frequent pulmonary and extrapulmonary microthrombotic and thromboembolic findings in patients with coronavirus disease 2019, appear to be consistent with the disease-specific hypercoagulability.

Drug-induced platelet function bleeding disorders are the most frequent PFDs and can easily be identified on the basis of recent administration of platelet-inhibiting drugs. Apart from these, the most challenging acquired PFDs are those caused by autoimmune mechanisms. In fact, demonstration of autoantibodies inhibiting platelet function may be difficult in most non-specialised centres. Among autoimmune PFDs (aPFDs), acquired Glanzmann thrombasthenia (aGT), which is caused by autoantibodies that bind to platelet &#945;IIbß3 integrin, inhibiting its function, is the most frequent. aGT can be associated with underlying haematological malignancies or autoimmune diseases but can also be idiopathic. More rarely, other immunemediated PFDs can occur, such as acquired delta storage pool disease (aÎ´SPD). Treatment of aPFDs must rely on the control of acute and chronic bleedings, treatment of the underlying disease in secondary forms, and immunosuppressive treatment for autoantibody reduction or eradication. aPFDs may completely resolve upon treatment of any underlying disease that may be present. In primary aPFDs, and in the majority of secondary forms, treatment relies on immunosuppressive therapies.Here we present a systematic review of previously described immune-mediated aGT and aÎ´SPD cases. Clinical and laboratory characteristics, treatments for the control of bleedings and for the eradication of autoantibodies, and responses to treatments are also discussed.

Complicating matters, discrepancies abound—particularly for interleukin 6 (IL-6)—possibly due to differences in sex, species/strain, and/or the brain regions studied. METHODS: As such, we clarified how cytokine expression changes with age by using a Bioplex and Western blot to measure multiple cytokines across several brain regions of both sexes, using 2 mouse strains bred in-house as well as rats obtained from NIA. Parametric and nonparametric statistical tests were used as appropriate. RESULTS: In the ventral hippocampus of C57BL/6J mice, we found age-related increases in IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-6, IL-9, IL-10, IL-12p40, IL-12p70, IL-13, IL-17, eotaxin, G-CSF, interfeuron δ, KC, MIP-1a, MIP-1b, rantes, and TNFα that are generally more pronounced in females, but no age-related change in IL-5, MCP-1, or GM-CSF. We also find aging is uniquely associated with the emergence of a module (a.k.a. network) of 11 strongly intercorrelated cytokines, as well as an age-related shift from glycosylated to unglycosylated isoforms of IL-10 and IL-1β in the ventral hippocampus. Interestingly, age-related increases in extra-hippocampal cytokine expression are more discreet, with the prefrontal cortex, striatum, and cerebellum of male and female C57BL/6J mice demonstrating robust age-related increase in IL-6 expression but not IL-1β. Importantly, we found this widespread age-related increase in IL-6 also occurs in BALB/cJ mice and Brown Norway rats, demonstrating conservation across species and rearing environments. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, age-related increases in cytokines are more pronounced in the hippocampus compared to other brain regions and can be more pronounced in females versus males depending on the brain region, genetic background, and cytokine examined.

u18xe814,,WHO,"The time-frequency connectedness among metal, energy and carbon markets pre and during COVID-19 outbreak",,,,unk,"The study investigates static and dynamic returns spillover effects between metal (gold, silver, copper and aluminum), energy (oil, natural gas and coal) and carbon markets in different frequency domains using the Diebold Yilmaz (2012) and the Baruník and Křehlík (2018) method. The results show that total connectedness in the post-COVID world is significantly higher compared to pre-COVID-19 outbreak period. The total spillover is contributed mainly by short-term spillover effects. Moreover, metal markets especially copper and silver have higher explanatory power. Spillover within markets is stronger than across these markets. In addition, the carbon market is more heavily interactive with other markets, and the metal market especially copper has relatively high explanatory power for the carbon price fluctuations in post-COVID-19outbreak periods. According to the net spillover, copper and gold has a hedge function in the short- and long-term, respectively. Furthermore, the relationship among these markets is time-varying, affected by market uncertainty such as the outbreak or major events.",2022,"Jiang, Wei Chen Yunfei",Resources policy,,#covidwho-1842858,,,,,248698377.0
